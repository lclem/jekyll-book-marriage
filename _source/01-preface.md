## Preface

IF some one denounces a butcher or grocer for giving
short weight, the denunciation implies the existence of a
system of weights and measures. If some one condemns
the conduct of a neighbor, the condemnation implies the
acceptance of an ethical standard which the neighbor is
alleged to have violated. And if it is asserted that something is wrong with marriage, there is equally implied a
standard of judgment, a criterium of what, with marriage,
would be right.

What then is the standard whereby marriage is to be
measured? Keyserling writes as if it were character development; Hamilton plans his research as if it were
primarily "sexual-reactive value"; the sociologists turn
out their textbooks in the seeming conviction that marriage is to be measured by its contribution to social welfare. Is there then no standard of excellence intrinsic to
marriage itself? The present essay purposes to explore
the ground in search of such a standard.

Since the book has such a purpose, there are a number
of things it cannot be. It cannot be a sex book, like
some recent productions, with hymns to contraception and
a sexological interpretation of history, for marriage involves more than sex. Neither can it range, like other
discussions of contemporary morals, through all fields of
ethical interest; it must be confined to the problem of
marriage. It cannot be a survey of marriage in America, \[p.viii\] 
such as resulted from Judge Lindsey's long observation
of the behavior of the youth of Denver, or from Dr. G. V.
Hamilton's scientific study of the lives of two hundred
New Yorkers, or from the interesting study of "Middletown" made by the Lynds. The marriage phenomenon
is more widely distributed in space than Denver, New
York, or Middletown, and in time than the twentieth
century. Just as the descriptive study of marriage and
family life concerns itself with particular times and
places, so the normative study searches for truths that
will be universally applicable, irrespective of time and
place. The descriptive method presents particular facts;
the normative method sets up universal standards.

Science is itself both descriptive and normative. Its
product is organized knowledge. The organization of
knowledge requires not only the collection of facts but
also the setting up of classifications and categories. The
facts are in the realm of the actual, the classifications in
the realm of the ideal. Facts are tested by observation,
classifications by logic. If marriage is to be treated as
an object of science, these two kinds of exploration must
go forward hand in hand. A science of marriage and
family life can be expected to develop, as economics,
political science, and sociology have already developed, in
the interplay of theoretical speculation and statistical research. Research such as Dr. Hamilton's study of what
is wrong with marriage in contemporary America calls,
therefore, for a complementary analysis of what is right
with marriage in all times and places.

Is it not strange that among all the multitude of sciences and academic disciplines which have set themselves
up in independent state, there is none which constitutes a
\[p.ix\]
science or theory of the family? It has happened, quite
by accident, that the study of family relations has been
regarded as a province of sociology. Books on the family
are classified as sociology, and the sociological point of
view has dominated the academic discussion of family
life. Our best organized thought upon domestic relations
proceeds from purely sociological postulates and imputes
to marriage and home primarily sociological standards
of excellence -- to perpetuate the race, to transmit the social heritage. But the point of view and the method of
sociology may after all, be ill adapted to the investigation of the essentials of family life. Doubtless if family
studies had happened to grow up as appendages to
economics or political theory, the methods and presuppositions of these disciplines would have been equally
inadequate. May it not then be useful to experiment
with sketching the outlines of a theory of the family
which shall build itself up immediately from the facts
and purposes that appear in marriage and home, without making use of the preconception that there are "social
institutions"? Such efforts as this may lead ultimately
to the creation of a new academic discipline which shall
furnish more adequate *cadres* for the organization of
thought upon this most pressing and intimate problem of
human life.

Acknowledgments are due to many friends whose
thought has been lavishly lent to this work. Among them
are to be mentioned Mervyn Crobaugh, Frederic Anderson, Malcolm McComb, Cecil Pearson and Joan Wilson
Pearson, Kenneth Robertson and Sidney Hawkins Robertson, Conrad P. Wright, Dr. Esther Caukin, and
Professor John Morris of New York University. Miss

Katherine Beswick and Edwin R. Clapp have been especially patient in reading and criticizing the manuscript.
The underlying thought out of which the book grew we
owe to the stimulating intellectual companionship of Professor Robert T. Crane of the University of Michigan.
