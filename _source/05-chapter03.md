## Chapter III: The Place of Domestic Theory among the Social Sciences

TO build a theory that will contain and explain the
variable imponderables of the marriage relationship
seems at the outset a rather shocking enterprise as well
as a formidable one. Such a theory must deal with the
intimate activities of two personalities in the home, a
secret, sheltered region, hedged about with barriers to the
outer world and cherished as the last refuge of privacy.
The scholars of the Victorian age were naturally reluctant
to enter its mysterious precincts. John Stuart Mill would
have been aghast at the idea of placing in a scholarly
context those essentials of family existence which a man
and his wife discuss together after they have gone to bed.
Malthus was conspicuously indifferent as to "whether or
not we shall find what we are seeking," and inclined, with
his brutal theory of moral restraint, to the notion that
we would not find it at all. We do not even possess a
word that will cover in a general way the problems of
family life as economics, for instance, covers the problems
of business life.

The Greeks had such a word. It was none other than
the word *oikonomia*. It was applied by them to the study
of all matters relating to the household, from the family
budget to the affection of one member for another.
Xenophon's treatise on *oikonomia* is an essay on domestic \[p.21\] theory and art. It touches very little upon the subject
matter of modern economics, but begins with the question:
"whether the management of the household is an art, like
the art of the physician . . . ," and then presents an exposition of the art in the form of a conversation between
a new-wedded husband and his bride:

> . . . When we were well enough acquainted, and were so
familiar that we began to converse freely with one another, I
asked her for what reason she thought I had taken her to be
my wife, that it was not purely to make her a partner to my
bed, for that she knew I had women enough already at my
command; but the reason why her father and mother had
consented she should be mine, was because we concluded her
to be a proper person to be a partner in my house and children:
for this end I informed her, it was, that I chose her before all
other women; and with the same regard her father and mother
chose me for a husband; and if we should be so much favored
by the gods that she should bring me children, it would be our
joint business to consult about their education and how to
bring them up in the virtues becoming mankind; for then we
may expect them to be profitable to us, to defend us and comfort us in our old age.

We need not follow the substance of Xenophon's argument; it is sufficient that we appreciate the fresh and
natural point of view of the newly married who are
supremely interested in their own personal destinies and
not at all in the destinies of the race. The bride is to be
a "proper partner in my house and children"; the children are to be brought up in virtue in order that "we may
expect them to be profitable to us, to defend us and comfort us in our old age." Such homely and appealing purposes as these would be recognized as sound by all who
marry, from Sganarelle to our own younger generation. \[p.22\] For the problems of the race and of society are apprehended in marriage as personal problems. It is our misfortune that the scholars have lost this point of view in
exploring the nature of the family.

Xenophon was not the only Greek who wrote upon
*oikonomia*. To Aristotle we owe a profound discussion of
the same subject. An important part of the first book of
Aristotle's *Politics* is devoted to an analysis of *oikonomia*
and especially of the distinction between *oikonomia*, the
household art, and chrematistics, the art of money-making. For *oikonomia*, according to Aristotle, is the art of
acquiring what is needful, while chrematistics is the art of
acquiring without limit. This profound distinction has
been lost to modern thought. It is a distinction which,
had we retained it, would have preserved us from the
blind absurdities of classical economics.

There is no modern system of thought -- unless indeed
it be in the field of ethical speculation -- which presumes
to treat of the art of acquiring what is needful. Modern
economics is a doctrine not of the household art, but of
the art of money-making. In Xenophon's book, Socrates
proves that he is really wealthier than his host, for though
the host has many estates and slaves he has even more
expenses and responsibilities. "Wealth," according to the
principles of *oikonomia*, is not a mere quantity of goods,
but a ratio of goods to needs. And this is the kind of
thinking that family life requires. But modern economics,
even it it disguises itself under a new name such as "welfare economics," is not a theory of acquiring what is
needful, but rather of acquiring without limit. It
corresponds to the Greek chrematistics rather than to
*oikonomia*. The doctrine which once treated of the house\[p.23\]hold in terms of human needs has disappeared, its very
name being usurped by a rival.

The history of European institutions shows clearly
enough the reasons for this submerging of the doctrine
of the household art. In the Middle Ages, social thinking
went hand in hand with theology; not till the fifteenth century, when keen Italian thinkers were reformulating the
Greek and Roman ideas which they had rediscovered, did
social theorizing achieve an independent intellectual
status. At that time it seemed that the Greek doctrine
of the family would be revived and the Greek point of
view would find new expression. Even before Machiavelli wrote *The Prince*, Alberti had written the most
distinctive book on the family since Xenophon -- a manuscript entitled *Della Famiglia*. His point of view was
the simple and natural one that had been Xenophon's.
He was concerned with the welfare of the family for
its own sake, and not for the sake of God or morality
or society or the nation. He dealt with ultimate values
in the domestic situation -- he discussed, in short,
"what is needful." Unfortunately, Alberti had no successors.

The family of Alberti's day was both a business enterprise and a family. The Medici bankers in the Middle
Ages kept their business and household accounts in the
same book. It did not occur to them that business could
be a separate compartment of existence. The commercial revolution of the sixteenth century changed this attitude. "Italian bookkeeping" which rigorously separated
business from family affairs became customary in all commercial operations. Business enterprise and family life
took leave of each other. The attention of students fol\[p.24\]lowed business, ignoring the family. Scholars wrote on
the principles of chrematistics, and called their product
economics.

The titles of works on the family have multiplied in
modern times, until they now choke fat bibliographies.
We have treatments of the family as a social institution,
as an educational institution, as an economic, even as a
spiritual institution -- but only very recently of the family
as a domestic fact, existing for itself and having its own
system of values, and being itself the test of "what is
needful." As one side or another of family life has projected itself into affairs, discussions and analyses of the
family have resulted. LePlay made an interesting classification of families, patriarchal, rooted, and unstable, as
he considered their contribution to the stability of the nation. He made the family the starting point of a system
of sociology. Luther set down in stark terms the abject
position of the wife, as he discussed the relation of the
home to God's plan. When the industrial revolution began breaking down the old family solidarity, a flood of
dissertations on the sanctity of the home, women's sacred
sphere, and the holy duties of parenthood poured forth.
But there has been no passionless survey of the home
from the theoretical side, as there has been, for example,
of the State.

This lack of an independent domestic theory is due
largely to the absence of a real need for such a theory
in the past. The theories of economics, political science,
and sociology were evolved in response to genuine problems of conduct and belief; they did not arise out of the
idle play of intelligence; they were forged to be the tools
of kings and the weapons of parties and parliaments. \[p.25\] The family presented no issue of conduct to the European
mind; men took it for granted.

Our own generation has seen a problem of the family
arise in an insistent and thought-compelling form, and
has seen the collapse of the sex-discussion taboo which
once vitiated all analyses of domestic matters. Thus we
are prepared for a revival of the ancient study of the art
of the household.

This revival is coming about largely in response to
pressure from below. Newspaper subscribers expect daily
counsel on family and marriage problems as a part of
their newspaper purchase. The Lynds, in the survey of
"Middletown," found that 68 out of 109 wives of working men and 26 out of 29 wives of business men read regularly or occasionally the Dorothy Dix syndicated column
of advice. Masses of sophisticated women who graduate yearly from universities and masses of taxpayers who support the public schools are demanding education for married life. Sganarelle now sits on the
school board, or even on the board of trustees of the university, where he can make Pancrace do his bidding.
And he is insisting that something be done about this
tangle of misconceptions and uncertainties which we
encounter in marriage. High schools have established
courses in home economics -- Xenophon's old word lent
back to the household whence it came. Universities have
offered courses, and organized departments to study some
of the related problems. In the Vassar Institute of
Euthenics, *oikonomia* comes once more into its own. The
outline of the summer session announces lectures on
"Social Problems of the Home," "Child Guidance,"
"Household Technology," and "The Manipulation of \[p.26\] Batters and Doughs." Aristotle's broad conception of
the rightful place of the family in the subject matter of
social thought, and his keen intuition that in the family
one has to do with a balancing of the necessities of human
nature, are still sound.

But the family has changed indeed since Greek times;
especially has it changed within the memory of the
present generation. The trend has been ever in the direction of freedom. The element of consent has become increasingly important. The arrangement of marriages by
parents is looked upon as an anachronism. The dissolution of marriage has become easier. Marriage begins with
the engaging of two free personalities, and continues as
long as there is mutual consent to its continuance. No
mystery in marriage is greater than this: that just as the
coming together of two bodies can create new life, so the
interplay of two free personalities engenders new personal values and realizes new and higher levels of conduct.
This is the fact toward which the schoolgirl gropes with
her crude belief in "the right man" and the consummate
personal relationship of love.

Perhaps it is best that the scholars of the past neglected
domestic theory, for their labors might have served only
to confuse and obscure the problems which confront us
today. A theory based on the notion of status and duty
would now be a useless encumbrance, for it is the personal element in the modern family that calls for an explanatory doctrine. It is this personal aspect of family
life which the three great systems of the social sciences
leave out of account. Political theory is primarily interested in human conduct as related to the will of the State,
economics in the situation where each individual seeks \[p.27\] his own advantage, sociology in the complex total of influences which people exert on each other by living in
groups. They do not concern themselves with the personal relationship.

The situation suggests that we draw up a theory of
marriage, which will explore conduct that springs out of
that relationship; which will examine attitudes like
jealousy or friendship as they occur between specific persons; which will describe the interplay of activity when
an individual finds himself in the presence of no such
generalized entity as a "state," a "market," or a "society,"
but simply in the presence of another individual like himself. Can we not undertake to study the family as the
State has been studied ever since Bodin and Hobbes laid
down the foundations of modern political theory, and as
the business world has been examined since Quesnay and
Adam Smith propounded their theories?

Here we make the basic assumption of domestic theory.
Let it be, if you will, a fictional assumption; it may none
the less be an enlightening one. We assume that the
relationship of husband to wife is one of personalities.
We will make the experiment of deducing the consequences of this assumption, of following out its corollaries,
and explaining its meanings. This experiment will involve, at least tentatively, the setting apart of an independent field of social study, which will be related to the
other main fields of the social sciences somewhat as is
indicated in the chart on the following page.

In exploring the nature of the family from these
postulates we will have to take into account political,
economic, and social facts, just as political theory, economics, and sociology have each something to say about 
\[p.29\] the family. We will recognize frankly the limitations of
all theorizing: that theory cannot take the place of wisdom. And yet we feel the driving need for a rigid and
self-consistent analysis of the domestic problem. Moreover, we are confident that theories relating to human
affairs, however logic-bound they may be, do not remain
mere neutral intellectual exercises, but develop a profound usefulness. As soon as they gain general credence
they serve not only to describe conduct, but also to justify
and determine it. If we say that an act is illegal or uneconomic, a complete theory of jurisprudence or of economics lends its wealth of meaning to our judgment.
Similarly, in our theory of the family, we will hope to
give meaning to the idea that certain kinds of conduct
are domestic, whereas others are nondomestic. Such is
our ultimate goal. Our starting point is the personal
character of the relationship of man to wife.

#### DOMESTIC THEORY AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES

||*Science or Discipline*|*Relationship*|*Subject Matter*|*View of Human Nature*|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|Social Sciences: deal with man in relationship to other men|||||
||Sociology|Social influence|The Group|Man responds to influence of group.|
||Political theory|Political domination|The State|Man subject to the will of other persons under authority.|
||Economic theory|Economic interest|The Economic System|Man acts in his own interests.|
||Domestic theory|Personal|The Family|Man acts in the interests of another person.| 

\[p.29\] In writing an Outline of Domestic Theory one would
endeavor first to define this personal relationship on which
marriage is based, just as the political scientist puzzles
the freshman by a definition of sovereignty on the first
page of his textbook. What does the lover mean who
says, "I love you for yourself alone?" Can this love be
transferred to another person? Will it remain constantly
the same? Must it include all the activities of the loved
one? These questions must all be taken into account.

What is a family? How are its members bound together? Should they be subject to the authority of a
dominant member, or is the family self-governing? What
is one to expect of his partner in marriage, and what may
be required in turn? Why marry at all? And perhaps
most difficult of all: Whom shall I marry? 

\[p.30\] Let the professor of domestic theory ponder these questions, and study the answers systematically. He may
perhaps create a "domestic man" as the economists have
created in the "economic man" a fictitious being who
figures as a norm of behavior. He will discover laws of
domestic behavior that will correspond to such coinage as
"the law of diminishing returns" in the sister sciences.
He will provide a terminology for precise discussion of
domestic problems. His cool, impersonal theorizing will
furnish a refuge from the bitterness of personal disagreement in family life, and be helpfully at hand in lovers'
conversations.
