## Chapter VII: The Family and Convention

IT is an axiom of courtship that a man and a woman
can best make love to each other when they are
isolated from the rest of the world. The presence of
another person inhibits them. Three is a crowd. The
crowd, be it three or a thousand, imposes upon lovers
a type of conduct to which they may not inwardly consent, and operates upon their minds in a subtle negative
way. They recognize this influence and seek to escape
from its restraint. Their breaking away is an anti-social
gesture of great symbolic significance. Simply by being
alone together they defy the world, and protest that in
the deepest interests of their lives they desire no intervention by their fellow men. In this anarchic spirit
families are born.

Nevertheless, the natural family runs in mesh with the
system of conventions which community opinion defines.
We continue to be sensitive, in family life as elsewhere,
to the opinions of people who personally mean nothing
to us. The little sidewalk bully stops tormenting his
playmate when the casual passer-by pauses to look at
him with disapproval. A wife or husband can be goaded
to fury by the remarks and gossip of neighbors. Even
the independent spirit who defies criticism or holds himself aloof from praise is still conscious that the community
has an opinion of him. The man who delights in shocking \[p.64\] the neighbors is taking account of the fact that there
are neighbors to be shocked. Whoever would escape
from the pressure of community opinion must renounce
completely the society of his fellow men. But in love
life and in family life such renunciation is only partial
and incomplete. Vain is the hope of the tenor who proposes to

>Find perfect peace  
Where joys never cease  
And let the rest of the world go by-y-y-y-y!

The two conflicting principles of conformity and independence are present in the organization of every home.
On the one hand, there is always the standardized conduct
which the community imposes upon family members; on
the other hand, there is the privacy of the home which
shelters the married couple from the community.

Whenever in the course of the daily adjustments of
family life the objection is put, "but people will make
remarks," or the interrogation is heard, "but what will
people say?", the whole subject of the relation of family
to society is brought to issue. For in some ways the
family must take account of the opinion of the community, and to some extent it must leave society out of
the reckoning. It must make some gestures of acquiescence to convention, and it must also withdraw
beyond the reach of convention. Where is the line to
be drawn?

It is purposed here to set forth three principles which
the family may use in dealing with the social conventions;
namely, the principle of *creative workmanship*, the principle of *isolation*, and the principle of *autonomy*. 

\[p.65\] The intricate mechanism by which the community imposes its standards upon the household is explained by
certain doctrines of sociology. The sociologists happen
to he more interested in the social functions of the family
than in the functioning of the family itself, but their doctrine is none the less valuable in this connection, for
whether we study the significance of the family in society,
or of society in the family, we encounter the same basic
laws of human behavior and the same fundamental dilemma of conformity versus individual freedom.

Sociological doctrines assume that the opinions and
conduct of individuals are largely determined by the
influence of other people around them. The white child
reared in the Indian camp learns the Indian language
and shares the opinions of the tribe. He looks at the
world and sees there what Indians see. He forms habits
that conform to the habits of those around him. The
same child in another environment would have learned
a different language, held different opinions, seen other
things in the world, and formed different habits. From
such simple illustrations as this we form the concept of
the *socially-given* which involves the collateral concepts
of the group, the culture, the institution, the social process, and perhaps the social force. There is, in this sense,
a socially-given element in the family.

In every culture there are standardized ideals of domestic conduct which each individual learns from his
social environment. Society teaches each individual his
proper role and status. In our own culture there is the
ideal of the stern and just father, the dutiful daughter,
the tender wife and loving mother, the obedient son.
One learns these standards of conduct just as he learns \[p.66\] the meanings of words, and in fact these ideals do actually become a part of the language. The word wife or
husband includes in its meaning some notion of the
standard correct conduct for wife or husband.

Naturally these meanings are distinctive for each culture. Here the wife must fetch food from the market,
there she must not be seen on the street; here she must
wear a wedding ring, there she must veil her face; here
she must give herself to her husband's guest, there she
must he chastely above suspicion: here she must obey,
there she may command; and all these notions of what
constitutes wifely conduct are incorporated with the
meaning of the word wife, by the society wherein they
respectively prevail.

Such concepts of rule and status form the *socially-determined* element of family life. They are the guaranty
of uniformity and recurrence in the behavior of individuals; they make a social institution of the family
organism which has its origin in an anti-social impulse.
The youth who defies his elders in marrying a girl of
his own choice nevertheless yields to them unconsciously
when he expects in his bride the qualities and behavior
they taught him to expect in a good wife.

The ideals are socially-given, but the concrete application to bare fact is left to the individual to accomplish.
The conventional code of domestic behavior is a tool
which husband and wife may use in fashioning a family
organization. It cannot create a family organization;
nothing but the personal activity of husband and wife
can do that. Those families to which husband and wife
bring different ideals of domestic conduct exemplify this
fact. 

\[p.67\] Helen, modern and American, marries Henry, old-fashioned and German. Helen wishes to get a job and
live in a better apartment. Henry believes that women
should confine themselves to the three K's, *Kinder,
Kueche, und Kirche*. They dispute about it. Helen
complains that Henry does not earn enough money to
enable them to live decently; Henry replies that Helen
is extravagant. When they then go to the divorce court,
the social service worker who looks up the case needs
but a glance to perceive that their socially-determined
conceptions of their respective roles in the family have
been so contradictory that they have been unable to
collaborate. Or, as we may put it, the tools society
gave them for home-building were so badly assorted that
they could not construct a satisfactory family.

But suppose they continue to get along nicely together
despite their divergent ideals; they melt into tenderness
after every quarrel; they meet each situation as it comes
along, on some matters fight their way to agreement, on
others never reach a compromise. Out of it all they make
a successful marriage. It would be difficult to regard this
successful family as a thing created for these people by
society; rather we would think of it as something they
themselves have created, just as truly as a poem or picture
is the creation of the poet or artist. It is an achievement
of creative workmanship.

Social convention sets before us the language which
domestic activity must speak, but not the speaking of the
language: society formulates the meanings which attach
to wifehood or parenthood, but does not govern the expression of these meanings. Society gives to acts their
meanings as symbols, but it does not go behind the sym\[p.68\]bolic significance nor control the personal attitudes which
the symbols express. If a wife lies with her husband's
guest her act receives its meaning from society. The
Eskimos call it an act of compliance, the Americans
an act of rebellion, just as the syllable *nine* stands for
a cardinal number in English and its sound equivalent
*nein* for a general negative in German. Yet the thing
which makes or mars family life is not so much the act
as the attitude expressed in the act, not so much overt
behavior as personal motive. Any attitude or motive, be
it compliance, rebellion, appreciation, or resentment, must
have as its source a personality; it cannot originate in
society. All that society does is to provide a medium
of expression.

Just as each people has its language, so also each culture has its domestic institution. Words are not always
necessary for communication; nor is the conventional
pattern of a family institution necessary for domestic
life. The deepest uniformities of human thought find
universal expression in laughter or tears, not in words.
That aspect of family life which touches us most nearly
may have nothing to do with institutional forms. Soldiers on foreign soil speak of an "international language"
of sex -- but this is not a socially-given system of symbols;
it is something that wells up from beneath socially-given
forms.

Luther used this fact to illustrate the nature of faith:
"When husband and wife are fond of one another, and
live together in love and in confidence in one another,
who shall teach them how they should act or not act,
say or not say, think or not think?" Who indeed!

This is a truth which liberates us, and makes us masters \[p.69\] of our domestic destiny. Just as any language can be
used by poet or story-teller to create a work of literature,
so also any system of domestic institutions affords symbols for the expression of good domestic life. Halide
Edib has opened the eyes of Westerners to the fact that
the married life of a Turkish woman is not so very different from the married life of a Western woman.

> [But] when one compared the married Turkish women with
the married American women . . . one saw that, whatever the
laws of society are concerning marriage, men and women are
home builders by nature and they create social units under
the name of family and strive to keep these units as stable
and happy as human nature allows them to be. Hence, the
position of Turkish women in the family compared not too
unfavorably with American women, in spite of the legend of
fantastic harems. . . . The setting was different, the characters varied, but it was the some old story. . . .[^7-1]

These remarks should be conned over by all those
who represent to us that they can save the family by
tightening divorce laws or loosening them, by raising the
age of consent, by requiring the publication of the banns,
by giving women extensive property rights, by increasing
the penalty for desertion or by legalizing "companionate
marriage." Such changes as these affect the real life of
the family only superficially.

It may he that some institutions serve better than
others to accomplish satisfactory family life, just as some
languages are better adapted than others for literary
uses. A modification of existing institutions might or
might not provide us with a more useful fabric of symbols
\[p.70\] and meanings than that which we already possess. Such
changes can neither save nor destroy the family. The
important thing about the family is not its institutional
structure, but the use that is made thereof. None of us
stand condemned by our institutional system to lead a
thwarted or unsatisfactory family life.

[^7-1]: Halide Edib, "A Turkish Feminist Views Women Here," *New York
	Times Magazine*, October 7, 1928. 

The critical fact in marriage, in so far as convention is
concerned, is, therefore, the agreement or disagreement
of husband and wife upon these conventions, whatever
they may be. The "emancipated woman" and the "old-fashioned woman" have each an adequate equipment in
ideals; each can work out in her own way a satisfactory
life, provided her partner in marriage is a man who
understands and sympathizes with her ideals. When two
who marry have acquired widely different ideals, it is
necessary for them to make a special effort to understand
one another. Just as one can write best in a language
with which he is familiar, so they can construct the best
family life who best understand the meaning of each
other's acts and aspirations.

Thus the principle of creative workmanship is applied
to family life. The family organization is created by
using social convention as a tool.

The community brings about conformity to its standards, not only by instilling ideals of conduct in the minds
of family members but also by imposing its will directly
upon a household. If husband and wife are always
wrangling and scolding in loud tones, the neighbors will
criticize and ridicule the quarrelsome pair. To avoid
this direct, external pressure, the family can withdraw
into itself.

The isolation of the family cannot withdraw it, how\[p.71\]ever, from the influence of those ideals of domestic conduct which we have acquired from the community and
which have become a part of ourselves. It can merely
serve to assure us an opportunity to apply these ideals
in our own way. The principle of isolation is thus a
corollary of the principle of creative workmanship.

It sometimes happens, in a crisis of domestic life, that
one spouse appeals to society against the other. The
domestic relations court is a forum especially created to
hear such appeals. And every community, every circle
of gossips and story-tellers, is, in effect, an informal domestic relations court, before which aggrieved wives and
husbands lay their causes and complaints. When an
appeal is made to society, whether formally to a court
of law or informally to the moot court of neighbors, the
privacy of the home is sacrificed, and the family ceases
to be a sanctuary within which one can shield himself
from the tyranny of the community. He incurs a heavy
responsibility for domestic disaster who thus lets down
the barriers and exposes his home life to the neighbors.

It is inevitable that husband and wife should reckon
with their community, but in this reckoning they must
regard themselves as conspirators who plot together
against an opponent, not as litigants who appear before
a judge. They may conspire to impress their neighborhood, but they must not call it into their house as umpire.
"Do not confide the interior of your home to any one,"
wrote Diderot to his daughter upon her marriage, "I do
not wish myself to know whatever it would be that you
would tell me; let it then be a mystery to all others."

The principles of creative workmanship and isolation
express respectively the use which the family makes of \[p.72\] convention, and the resistance which it offers thereto.
These two principles taken together constitute the principle of autonomy, the principle that each family is,
within a certain range of activity, a law unto itself.

Our analysis of the natural family as a pre-social unit
has prepared us to understand that no social code of
domestic behavior could be exhaustive. Neither the
ideals which society subtly instills into its youth nor the
standards of behavior which it overtly enforces upon
families can cover every move and gesture of domestic
life. There is always a field of domestic life which
society makes no pretension to control. Within this margin of freedom husband and wife face each other unguided, and have their destiny completely in their own
hands.

Among those things over which the community exercises no supervision are included some of the most important marital affairs. As regards coitus, for instance,
conventions require that it shall not be public; beyond
that there is no code. So long as public scandal is avoided
and discussion suppressed, it makes no difference to society whether the sex life of the family is a matter of
violence and rape or of love and mutual desire. Concerning other matters the community insists on imposing
standards. The neighbors do not permit it to go unchallenged if the wife takes a job while the husband
stays home to mind the baby. In other civilizations these
rules may be drawn differently. Nowhere are they drawn
to cover completely the whole of domestic existence.

We flatter ourselves that our institutions encourage
freedom and expression of personality in marriage, but
this is true only in a relative sense. If our ideals of con\[p.73\]duct are more vague, and our rules and conventions more
uncertain, it follows therefrom that more play is left for
personality and freedom. But freedom and personality
cannot be a social contribution to family life; they are
rather the consequence of a more complete abdication
of society with respect to domestic affairs. If the family
relationship is essentially personal, this is not due to a
dictum of society but is rather a welling up of a more
elementary fact, which derives from a biological situation and not from social convention.

Thus we return to the deep divergence between the
family as a fact in nature and the family as a social
institution. If our fabric of social rules does not cover
everything of importance in family life, this is no temporary accident. It is not a passing situation due to
some dislocation in modern society and destined to disappear when certain inconsistencies in our social standards shall have been removed and certain articles of our
code of domestic behavior more fully elaborated. It is
rather due to an incompatibility of the inner nature of
society with the inner nature of the family. The excellence of the former is in regularity and recurrence and
imitation. The excellence of the latter is in its distinctiveness and originality and creation.

It follows that the important field of domestic activity
is precisely that field which society makes no pretense
at ruling. This basic incompatibility of society and
family is reflected in the contradictory assumptions of
sociological thinking on the one hand, and courtship on
the other.

Sociologists since Comte have recognized that in the
science of society "the individual" must be regarded as \[p.74\] an abstraction, if "society" is to be regarded as real.
There is always a bias in sociological thinking against
attaching importance to the unique and nonrecurrent.
Separate individual facts have meaning in sociology only
in so for as they can stand as symbols for general laws;
distinct biological individuals are of interest only in
so far as they participate in the phenomena of group
life.

The academic sociologists are not the only ones who
make use of this type of thinking. Every tourist who
visits a foreign country comes back with a string of
stories about the way "they" do things over there. If
he has seen a woman pulling a plow in a field, or a
peasant's house which is shared by some of the live
stock, or some example of striking courtesy or immorality or poverty, he interprets these sights sociologically.
He thinks from the point of view of one who makes a
study of customs. The real importance of the sight
of the woman plowing, to his mind, is that it indicates
that all women, or many women, plow in the fields of
the region.

In courtship and marriage, the point of view is the
reverse. "The thing about you and me is that we're
so different from the rest!" Is this not the theme of
every courtship? Whereas every study of society,
whether it be by a casual tourist or an academic specialistY proceeds on the assumption that we do not differ
from the rest except in insignificant details, the lover's
thought takes it for granted that the important things
about us are those wherein we differ. This attitude is
implicit in the selective function of mating. When a
man says to his "girl friend," "You are just like the \[p.75\] other girls," he speaks less as a lover and more as one
making a study of customs.

The same divergence between family and society are
evidenced when we contrast the conception of personality
which courtship takes for granted with that which an
observer of society must use. Since society does not
take account of individuals as such, sociology is hampered
in its study of personality. It cannot take account of
personality without first re-defining the term and giving
it a special and restricted meaning, which does not correspond to the meaning we usually give to the word. If
personality is to enter into sociological calculations it
must first be re-defined as "the subjective aspect of culture" (Thomas), and envisaged as a social product.
Here, for instance, is a sociological definition of personality taken from an introduction to sociology:

> The person is an individual who has status. We come into
the world as individuals. We acquire status and become persons. Status means position in society. The individual inevitably has some status in every social group of which he is a
member.[^7-2]

Such definitions serve to obscure but not to overcome
the incompatibility of personality and society, and the
limitations of sociological theory. Even after sociology
has newly defined personality as individual plus status,
it is still limited in that it can only explain and describe
so much of a person's conduct as reflects his status;
it cannot explain or describe conduct that reflects individuality.

The amateur sociologist touring Europe falls into a
\[p.76\] similar way of thinking. If he strolls along the quay
at Naples he is looking for types of fishermen or beggar
girls; he sees them as individuals with status. And so
it is with nine-tenths of the persons we meet: we think
of them in connection with their position in the community. We see the iceman and the mayor's wife and
the high school principal. Their position seems to he an
important part of them, whereby we identify them in
our minds.

[^7-2]: R. E. Park and E. W. Burgess, *Introduction to the Science of
	Sociology* (University of Chicano Press, Chicago, 1924), p. 55. 

But in a love affair another way of thinking prevails.
The rationale of biological selectivity requires it. In
courtship and marriage such expressions as "I love you
for yourself alone" imply a conception of personality
diametrically opposed to that which a student of society
must use. From the standpoint of sociology the lover's
concept seems mystical; from the standpoint of courtship the sociologists' concept seems unreal.

It is difficult here to do justice to the intricacy of our
way of thinking. Of course the lover is seen by his beloved to have his status as lover, the wife is seen by her
husband to have the wifely status. But the mind quickly
passes beyond the consideration of status and dwells
more intently upon the unmeasurable and inexpressible
fact of personality, which alone gives rise to everything
that is of importance in family life.

The principle of autonomy makes it seem obvious that
it cannot be an aim of domestic life merely to conform
to convention. Conformity to convention can be only
a means to an end. If we say of our Bohemian friends
that in their family life they are "unconventional" we
are adverting to a conspicuous but none the less unimportant aspect of their domestic life. It is as if we \[p.77\] should describe their new car by saying that it bears no
license plates, and leave unsaid whether it is a Ford
or a Cadillac, whether it runs well or ill.

The significant facts of family life are worked out in
an inner domain where social influence does not reach.
The external resemblance of one family to another is not
a matter of importance. For families do not duplicate
each other in their essential structure. Each family works
out for itself, beyond the range of convention, some
peculiar way of life. This sell-organization, whatever
it may be, is the one thing that really matters in terms
of human life.
