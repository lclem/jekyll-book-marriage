## Chapter II: Diverse Theories of Marriage and of the Family Which Now Prevail

HE who writes a theory of marriage has no blank
page to write upon. There are already among
us at least four conceptions of marriage, not always clearly
stated, but nevertheless widely believed. The conflict
and confusion of their varying tenets echo in every casual
conversation on the subject, and in our social judgments
and attitudes they have their full share of influence. One
theory is naive, two are sophisticated, one is pedantic.
We might name them, for convenience, the *schoolgirl
theory*, the *mousetrap theory*, the *tomcat theory* and the
*theory of the schools*.

There is implicit in the schoolgirl's attitude toward her
beau a simple but consistent view of love and marriage,
which often gives the conventional marriage to which
it leads a wrong start and adds to the inevitable disillusionment of middle age. According to this view, in
which both sexes participate, one marries when one is in
love. But one must be truly in love, and so a mistake
of fact is fatal. The distinguishing characteristics of
true and genuine love are that it never dies, and that it
guarantees happiness if one marries, and sorrow if one
does not. If, having married, one finds oneself unhappy,
then it is evident that true love is lacking. The only
valid explanation of such a situation is that a mistake \[p.8\] has been made and that love did not ever exist at all.
On this account a wise young person is very careful not
to marry until the fact of true love is very definitely
established. Here arises the great difficulty: there is no
final test of true love save marriage; to test the egg one
must break it. The only test that even the most careful
can make before marriage is, according to this theory,
"the test of one's own heart."

This schoolgirl theory is the Western World's basic view
of the relation of love to marriage. If by a feat of
imagination we remove it from our mental ken, most
fiction and modern drama becomes unintelligible. Even
the most sordid product of the naturalist school, or such
a work as Ben Hecht's pornographic triumph, *Fantasius
Mallaire*, presupposes a familiarity on the part of the
reader with this schoolgirl theory. All other theories are
corrections and criticisms of this one. Though the
sophisticated abandon it, the cigar-store cynics scoff at
it, the professors overlook it, nevertheless it remains
unshaken in the popular mind. Even those who reject
it for themselves are likely to encourage young people
to believe it, as mothers teach their children to believe
in Santa Claus. Moreover -- and this is the most important of all -- the great majority of young men and women
who are actually doing the marrying or who are wrestling
with the problem of whether or not to marry, that is to
say, the great majority of people in their late teens and
early twenties, govern their conduct on this schoolgirl
theory.[^2-1]

[^2-1]: This fact is objectively demonstrated in the interesting and scholarly
	study of an average American community made under the direction of
	Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd: *Middletown* (Harcourt, Brace,
	New York, 1929).] 

\[p.9\] Whence came this curious imagery wherewith so many
of us are accustomed to construct our views of family
life? It did not come to us from scholars, like our
theories of the State or of economics. The schoolgirl
theory is not accredited among scholars. It has no
academic standing. It has grown out of two strangely
different nurseries, of the preachers on the one side and
of the poets on the other.

The Provençal singers of the Middle Ages, the French
and Italian courtiers of the Renaissance, drew up a delicate and fantastic view of the erotic side of life. The
Church contributed a somber and serious view of marriage. The two doctrines grew up quite independently,
to be finally combined in a popular morality.

The Mediaeval and Renaissance theory of love was
not a theory of marriage; the Courts of Love even decreed that true love was not possible in wedlock. True
love was pictured as a kind of fixed-idea phenomenon,
an almost psychopathic mode of behavior, seldom met
with in fact. The Church's view of marriage, on the
other hand, had little regard for love but suggested the
curious concept that marriage was a spiritual union similar to the union of Christ with his Church. Eroticism
appeared as a necessary though somewhat degrading incident of married life. And when the Church spoke of
erotic life, its language was anything but poetic: "The
wife shall not deny her body to the husband, nor the
husband to the wife." Such was the crude dictum. The
only thing that was common to the preachers and the
poets was the notion of permanence. Poets and courtiers
said that true love was everlasting; the Church said
that marriage was irrevocable; now the schoolgirl says \[p.10\] that both must be permanent and that they must coincide.

In the face of the manifest improbability that true
love, rare enough in itself, should coincide with marriage,
the schoolgirl resorts to the expedient of a *deus ex
machina*, the "right man," the prince. If the "right
man" appears, all difficulties vanish; the conjunction of
true love is established, eternal felicity is assured; nothing
remains but to marry and live happily ever afterward.
Consequently the all-sufficient preparation for marriage
is the daydream, wherein the image of the prince or the
dream girl is defined. The actual identification in the
flesh of prince or dream girl must be left to intuition.
And a young person's thought upon marriage is considered
amply developed when he has made an imaginative character sketch of a future mate.

The cult of the prince and the dream girl, the "right
man" and the unknown goddess, rounds out the schoolgirl theory. The theory is dangerous to human happiness
because it suggests no explanation for unhappiness in
marriage except the explanation that the marriage itself
was a mistake; it counsels no course of action to improve
an unsuccessful married life except the divorce court.
It turns the minds of both man and woman back toward
a single decision of their lives -- the choice of each other
as partners -- and diverts their minds from the innumerable decisions which they make every day. It gives to
every marriage the character of being saved or lost as
soon as the ceremony is completed, so that all that remains is to let time reveal the wisdom or foolishness of
the initial step.

What actually happens in everyday life is that people \[p.11\] sooner or later give up their "illusions," as they say, and
recognize that their partners are neither princes nor
dream girls, and find plenty of opportunity for exercising
constructive ingenuity in developing their married lives.
The false evaluations of the schoolgirl theory may not
wreck marriages, but do consistently give them a false
start.

The converse of the schoolgirl theory is the tomcat
theory. This latter is the product of disillusionment or
worldly wisdom. The premises of the tomcat theory are
simple. Man is a predatory creature; he is sex-minded;
he requires sex satisfaction. Whether he is to seek this
satisfaction in marriage or out of it depends partly on
the general merits of the marriage institution. There
is no expectation that the partners in marriage will be
extraordinary people. Whereas the schoolgirl's ideal marriage requires that bride and groom he exceptional and
unique, the tomcat ideal reckons with the fact that all
men and women are pretty much alike. Whereas the
schoolgirl ideal demands true love, the tomcat ideal is
satisfied if marriage is put on a sex basis. Consequently
the tomcat theorists do not bother with character sketches
of ideal mates -- except perhaps to insist upon physical
beauty or "sex appeal" -- but their speculations often constitute a thoughtful judgment on the merits of the marriage relation itself.

The principles of the tomcat theory are illustrated
in that memorable Rabelaisian conversation in which
Panurge, seeking advice from Pantagruel upon his proposed marriage, presents arguments pro and con, while
Pantagruel replies alternately, "Marry then, in God's
name," and, "Then in God's name do not marry." 

> \[p.12\] "But you see," quoth Panurge, "since I cannot get along
without a woman would it not be much better for me to associate myself with some pure and honest woman rather than to
get a new one every day, with continual danger of beating, or
of disease which would be worse?"

> "Well, then, in God's name, marry. . . ."

As the long argument unwinds, Panurge displays the
characteristic tomcat attitude: he wants to marry because he needs a woman; he hesitates chiefly because
he doubts whether he will have exclusive possession of
the woman he marries. The central fact of marriage,
to him, is sex competition.

When marriage is looked upon as an instrument of
sex satisfaction, its superiority to the unmarried state
is claimed upon the ground that it stabilizes sex relations.
It offers a vested interest in sex satisfaction, in lieu of
a precarious tenure. It affords an expectation that there
will be permanent rather than transitory attachments,
and guarantees that the children will be the objects of
fixed legal rights and duties. Thus the chief *raison d'être*
of marriage is its proprietary result. A husband or wife
is a species of property purchased at a risk with one's
own liberty. In making the purchase one seeks to give
up as little liberty and to obtain as complete a possession
as is possible. Marriage therefore does not end sex
competition, but gives it a new orientation. Husband
and wife seek each to enforce an exclusive sexual right
over the other, and to resist a like enforcement as regards
himself.

To the man's insistence that his wife shall not make
him a cuckold there corresponds the woman's concern \[p.13\] that she shall "hold" her husband. She must curb his
predatory predilections and monopolize his affections.
The comic strips and the feature pages of the newspapers
tacitly recognize this as a proper wifely preoccupation.
An elaborate technique has been devised for holding a
husband -- a technique wherein the arts of cookery and
the devices of harlotry have equally their place. This
technique has been made known to the world in the racy
popularizations of Elinor Glyn. It takes for granted an
essential antagonism between husband and wife. By
making porridge without lumps and by choosing appropriate personal perfumes; by toasting bread without burning it and by wearing silk underwear -- by such means
as these does a wife fulfill the purposes of a tomcat marriage. The test of success, for husband and wife alike,
is the physical fidelity of one's partner to the marriage
bed.

A variant of the tomcat theory is the view which
Havelock Ellis has expounded as the mousetrap theory.
This theory is humorously defended by H. L. Mencken,
and seriously propounded by the eminent sociologist, Professor McDougall:

> The essence of the institution of marriage is that custom, law and public opinion force man to submit to a bond, to give
binding guarantees under penalties, as a condition of obtaining
satisfaction of strong desires. . . . The young man would prefer to have his lady love entrust herself to him without other
guarantees than his vows of devotion . . . but society, dominated in the main by the matrons and the graybeards, takes
a more cynical and skeptical view of the devotion inspired
by sex attraction. The experience of the ages has taught it
that too often love is fleeting; that in the companionship of
the sexes, as elsewhere, familiarity too often breeds indifference \[p.14\] and not seldom engenders friction and resentments . . .
[hence] . . . the mothers and fathers will not give up their
daughters to their lovers without the guarantee of the marriage bond.[^2-2]

If there is no better defense of marriage than that
which McDougall offers here -- that marriage is good because it serves to keep together people who would prefer
to be apart -- it may prove difficult to convince the new
generations that marriage is worth while. For man may
find a way to the "satisfaction of strong desires" without
"giving bond," and the mothers and fathers may find that
it does not rest with them to decide whether their daughter
shall be given to her lover or not. The mousetrap theory
constitutes a joyless acknowledgment that marriage is a
fetter.

The schoolgirl theory is aesthetically satisfying but
scientifically outrageous; the tomcat and mousetrap theories are in accord with common sense observation but
they insult aesthetic sensibilities. All of these theories,
however, relate directly to matters which are of immediate concern to the young people who are doing the marrying. With most of the professors it is otherwise. Their
theories of marriage are aesthetically inoffensive and
scientifically plausible, but they have little bearing on
the aspects of marriage which are in fact most perplexing. The professors declare that the family is a fundamental group in the complex of groups that make up
society. They assert that the family has two functions
of basic importance: the propagation of the species and
the transmission of the social heritage in the education
of the young. All this is very true; it is elaborated and
\[p.15\] proved over and over again in innumerable books; it
enters the doctrine of all the social sciences. It constitutes a laborious and indisputable answer to a question
that nobody asks.

[^2-2]: McDougall in *The Forum*, July, 1928. 

Of what value are these scholarly dicta to the common
man? A man likes to have harmony in his family group,
but he cares nothing about the fundamental position of
the family group in the structure of society. He may
marry in order to have children, but he certainly does
not marry in order to propagate the species. He may
pay for the education of his child, but he cares not one
whit tor the transmission of the social heritage. His
real interests in the family lie on a plane of personality
which the theorizing of the scholars does not touch.

When Molière's Sganarelle approached the learned
Pancrace to obtain advice as to whether he should marry,
he got little aid. Pancrace first demanded of him whether
he wished to speak Italian, Spanish, German, English,
Latin, Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew, and when Sganarelle
admitted that he spoke only French the Savant told
him, "Please pass to the other side, for this ear is reserved for scientific and foreign languages, the other
is for the mother tongue." And after he had passed to
the other side and asked his question again, he still got
no satisfaction, tor Pancrace insisted on talking about
logic and art and the use of language. So Sganarelle
went off muttering, "To the devil with these savants
who will not listen to people."

The professors are still suspected of preferring languages that are foreign to the common man. We can
imagine a modern Pancrace demanding: "Do you wish to
discuss this from the legal, ethical, economic, or social \[p.16\] point of view?" If Sganarelle then replies that it is a
personal matter, Pancrace leans back in his chair and pronounces, "Oh, that is different," knits his brows and wonders what he can say. He would find it difficult to draw
upon his scholarly knowledge for any counsel that would
be of real value. For the academic teaching pertaining
to marriage and the family seems quite irrelevant in the
solution of a real difficulty. The professors are found
making definitions that do not clarify real problems, and
ignoring the question upon which there is a universal
demand for more light. There can still lie found those
who will turn away from the schools damning "the savants
who will not listen to people."

Within the past few years there have been indications
that the scholars are changing their attitude. A greater
number of genuinely useful books on marriage have been
published since 1920 than were published in the preceding
century. The Protestant Church view of sex, love, and
marriage has been formulated by a national Committee on
Marriage and Home.[^2-3] A survey of the social and legal
branches of family law, including marriage and divorce,
birth-control legislation, and the financial relationship
between husband and wife, is being conducted at Columbia University. President MacCracken's Institute of
Euthenics at Vassar College and Count Keyserling's great
symposium on marriage, as well as Dr. Hamilton's masterly research, represent noteworthy efforts to be helpful.
President MacCracken has set out to found an applied
science of home-making; Count Keyserling has conducted
a literary "symphony" of opinion in which the thoughtful
\[p.17\] mind can detect certain dominant themes of a marriage
philosophy. Dr. Hamilton has begun the gigantic task of
describing objectively and statistically the married lives
of normal people.[^2-4] There is a new interest and a new
spirit of inquiry in matters relating to the family, but
there has not issued forth from the schools any new doctrine to meet the needs of the common man, and to supplant the schoolgirl and the tomcat theories of marriage.

[^2-3]: "The Protestant Church View of Sex, Love and Marriage," in *Current 
	History*, February, 1929. 

The material for such a new doctrine is being accumulated with great diligence. There is under way the creation of a social science which will devote itself exclusively
to the study of the family. Ernest R. Groves, even though
he may not admit it, is another of the founders of the
coming science. He writes on "Social Problems of the
Family," but his real interest is in the personal problems
of family members. A vast and chaotic literature exists.
There are books by free-love writers who denounce love\[p.18\]less wedlock, books by socialists and feminists who resent
sex inequality in marriage, enthusiastic books by eugenists
who seek by enlightened mating to prevent race deterioration, indignant books by conservatives who protest against
the break-up of the home. The list of able men and
women who contribute to this literature grows rapidly:
C. P. Gilman, Ernest R. Groves, Beatrice Hinkle, Willystine Goodsell, E. R. Mowrer, Margaret Mead, Mary
Ware Dennett, Count Keyserling, and S. D. Schmalhausen to go along with the names of such pioneers
as Westermarck, Havelock Ellis, and Mueller-Lyer. The
files of learned magazines which give attention to the
family problem grow longer as the years pass. Whether
a periodical be devoted to charities or child welfare,
parentage or prostitution, its editors recognize the problem of the family as an insistent object of their attention.

[^2-4]: Dr. G. V. Hamilton is a pioneer in the statistical investigation of the
	sex lives of normal married people. He selected as subjects one hundred
	married men and one hundred married women of New York City, trying
	to balance his selection in such a way that about half were happily
	married, half unhappily. He then took down the answers these subjects
	gave to a long series of carefully propounded and devastatingly intimate
	questions. The number of cases examined was too small, the selection
	too arbitrary, even the scope of the questioning (predominantly on sex
	matters) too restricted, to allow his findings to stand as a true statistical
	picture of marriage in America. The investigator himself disavows this
	intention. The fact remains that on many of the most significant points
	of fact in marriage relations, Dr. Hamilton's figures are the only ones
	that represent more than a guess. For Hamilton has done several things
	that are new. Although his approach is that of a psychiatrist, he has
	undertaken to study normal marriage. And he has striven relentlessly
	to secure results into which no surreptitious influence of the investigator's
	prejudices has crept. His results are published in two volumes, *A Research in Marriage* by Hamilton, and *What is Wrong with Marriage*, by
	Hamilton and McGowan (A. & C. Boni, New York, 1929). 

Despite this apparatus of discussion and erudition,
there has been so far no thorough and consistent scholarly
covering of those aspects of family life which are of
greatest interest to us. Neither sociology nor sexology
suffices. "Our study of the family has been like the blind
man describing the elephant," said Professor Eliot before
a meeting of scholars and social workers. But the tendencies now clearly visible will lead ultimately to the
establishment of a department of scholarly inquiry which
will not ignore the romantic and personal sides of family
life, but will rather focus attention upon them. The girl
poet says to her lover:

> Whether or not we find what we are seeking  
> Is idle, biologically speaking.   

\[p.19\] The time is at hand for the laying out of a field of disciplined investigation wherein it will no longer be idle
whether or not we find what we are seeking in marriage.
There is room for a new branch of the social studies which
can deal as amply with the problems of family life as
economic theory deals with the problems of getting a
living, or political science with the problems of the State.
