  	<em>What is Right with Marriage</em> began as a sort of academic joke: an attempt to apply every social science theory at once (sociological, economic and political) to the micro-society of the modern married couple. It turned into a serious essay attempting to define the personal space which these theories cannot explain, to develop what the Binkleys called "domestic theory". The book was a contribution to the 1920s debate on marriage which followed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-wave_feminism">first-wave feminism</a>. The Binkleys felt the time was ripe for this debate: "A greater number of genuinely useful books on marriage have been published since 1920 than were published in the preceding century." <a href="https://www.wallandbinkley.com/rcb/works/marriage/04-chapter02.html">(p.16)</a> The book was not a great commercial success, but it did sell and was reviewed; and the advance financed the Binkleys' <a href="https://www.wallandbinkley.com/rcb/2009/09_24_a-summer-in-italy-1929-part-1.html">trip to Italy</a> in the summer of 1929.
