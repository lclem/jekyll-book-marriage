THE authors of this little book are married. They
have been married for years. Having loved each
other completely, they still do not venture to dogmatize
upon the probability that this love will continue through
an indefinite future, but they think that their marriage
has been successful, and they expect it to continue
so. And they recall with indulgent tenderness the caution
and circumspection with which they made the decision
to marry.

They prepared the way with an extraordinary amount
of preliminary thought and discussion. It was a curious
argument, carried on in that spirit of mingled playfulness
and earnestness which is natural to two young people
who sit together in the moonlight. Their purpose was to
clarify their own ideas on the problem and mystery of
marriage. Their method was the method of the schools.

For both of them had been long in the atmosphere
of the schools. They were familiar with the quaint attitudes which professors take toward the practical problems of life. They had learned in their classes many of
the intricate theories of human conduct which are held
in university circles. The language of the social sciences
\[p.2\]
flowed easily from their lips. And yet they recognized
that the question then uppermost in their minds -- whether
to marry or not to marry -- was one which the textbooks
evaded and the theories missed. They set forth therefore
to write their own textbook and to construct their own
theory. Upon their collaboration was shed not only the
light of the student's lamp but also the light of the stars.
This outline of domestic theory is the result.

It is not easy to view with scholastic detachment anything so intimately personal as one's own courtship is
while it is in progress. Moreover, there stands a wide-spread prejudice against such an attitude. It is generally
believed that marriage should result from impulse rather
than from reasoned judgment and decision. A cold calculating of consequences or a mathematical estimating
of probabilities is thought to be foreign to the spirit of
the institution. The only frame of mind which can decently be held by bride or groom is one of naive and
unbounded optimism. An atmosphere of illusion is
deemed as needful as a ring and a clergyman for the
conventional wedding. The privilege of attempting to
see things as they are is reserved for the onlookers who
exchange the stock currency of wedding jests.

If two young things nevertheless make the effort to
look upon their own prospective marriage as impersonally
as if it were not their own, and to scrutinize it as calmly
as it it were an investment proposition, they still lack
definite standards by which to judge whether their life
plan is sound or unsound. They have no way of knowing
what kind of conduct is normal in married life, nor of
estimating which of the desired satisfactions they can
reasonably hope to obtain and which they must dismiss 
\[p.3\] 
as illusory. They find that there is no clearly established
notion of what constitutes success in marriage, no well-defined distinction between the essential and the incidental.

The smooth generalizations which are most current on
this subject do not stand criticism. For instance, it is
said that the test of a successful marriage is happiness;
the purpose of a marriage is to attain happiness; a marriage is a failure which does not bring happiness; those
persons are well mated who continue to be happy though
married. But happiness is a general aim, which we pursue in marriage as in other things; it does not constitute
a specific aim proper to marriage alone. If I decide to
go to college or to move to New York or to trade in my
Chevrolet, all these decisions are equally made in the
interests of prospective happiness. Certainly then one
cannot demand of a marriage that it should guarantee
happiness regardless of all other circumstances. Here
is one man whose marriage was perhaps the best and
wisest act of his life, but who has always been dogged
by misery and misfortune; here is another whose matrimonial ventures have three times ended in divorce, who
nevertheless persistently takes pleasure in life. On the
strength of these facts we cannot judge the marriage of
the first to have been a failure and the marriage of the
second to have been successful. There is truth in the
idea that marriage has to do with some kind of a total
product of well-being or of misery; it is more legitimate
to identify success in marriage with happiness than to
identify success in business with happiness. But still the
generalization that happiness is the end and aim of marriage is too indefinite to be useful. 

\[p.4\] 
In the maze of discussion to which every Sunday paper
contributes and upon which every acquaintance has vigorous opinions there is no end of contradiction and perplexity. Is eternal and undying love a psychological
possibility or a probability? Does conjugal faithfulness
normally turn out to be a pleasing habit or an irksome
restriction? If permanence, stability, and companionship
in old age be deemed the aim of marriage, what (in view
of divorce statistics) are the mathematical chances that
a marriage will yield this product? Which is to be held
more sacred, love or marriage, if the two do not coincide?
Should loveless wedlock be dissolved or can it he made
worth while? There was the case of a student friend
who lay all evening moaning on his bed: "She wanted
to know if I'd love her always -- damn it -- I told her I
didn't know -- damn it -- I told her she'd have to take
a chance -- damn it -- she turned me down." Which had
the more accurate and sensible understanding of matrimony, the man or the girl who turned him down?

The confusion of standards is particularly perplexing
to a young woman. No formula for her conduct is unchallenged. Her duties are everywhere uncertain. How
much independence can she retain after marriage? When
factories and offices welcome the help of women, when
schools offer to girls the same opportunities for technical
training that they afford to men, when apartment houses
relieve wives of most of the tasks that kept their mothers
busy from dawn to dusk, must she still accept it as the
normal course of things that no career is open to the
married woman but the primitive round of kitchen and
kinder? If a professional woman wishes to experience
motherhood, must she risk the submerging of her person\[p.5\]ality in marriage? Shall we try to close the aesthetic
enjoyment of sex life to all who are not prepared to assume the obligations of the married state? From courtship to divorce, from petting to birth control, all conduct
is subjected to conflicting ethical judgments.

The situation is not explained as a mere prevalence
of sin and wrongdoing in a corrupted age, for the standards by which sin and wrongdoing are to be identified are
the very things that are called in question. The questioning is not the product of artful casuistry nor of
conversational posing; it is deeper than the pretensions
of the tea-room *précieuse*, and more serious than the
speculations of a college sophist. Whether we approve
or not we must accept the fact that marriage is no longer
what it used to be. It has new meanings: it brings new
consequences to those who undertake it. Our prevailing
theories of marriage no longer fit the facts.

Perhaps the reason for the lack of a commonly accepted
theory of domestic life lies in the fact that the family,
no longer functioning as an economic unit, nor as a political institution, has come to rest upon a peculiarly
individual sort of relationship, capable of the widest variation. We find it difficult to apply to it any set of general
laws, or to fit it into logical schemes. The poet or the
writer of fiction is perhaps better fitted to describe and
define the elements of a domestic theory than is the
logician or the scientist. A domestic relationship is at
once general, like the relationship of citizen to state or
buyer to seller, and particular, like the relationship of
Caesar to Brutus or Héloïse to Abélard.

It may well be that an entirely new theory or scheme of
domestic relationships must be drawn up by each couple \[p.6\] entering into them. Sometimes this theory is actually
evolved retrospectively, after years of married life; sometimes it never finds expression in words, but only in
conduct and attitudes. More often the development of a
scheme of future relationships is a function of the courtship. And so it is with this present domestic theory -- it
is a courtship now after four years written down. In
it the authors have made a systematic statement of certain great banalities which were a common minimum of
their belief.

They have chosen, moreover, to state these banalities
as social theory. They might have put their thought
into the form of a prenuptial agreement, a decalogue or
a motto. They preferred the deductive procedure of the
social sciences because in such an organized presentation
there is a possibility, however slight, that something more
generally useful may be found.
