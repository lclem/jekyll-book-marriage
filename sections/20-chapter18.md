THE principles of marriage value and of marriage
art have necessarily brought to a common focus
the problem which confronts the individual acting alone
and the problem which confronts two individuals acting
together. For both of these situations are present where
marriage value and marriage art are at stake.

But in the inner forum at the mind where decisions are
made there is only One. And hence the result of a synoptic treatment of the activity of One and Two brings a
certain amount of conclusion. Problems of marriage value
come, ultimately, to the problem of the personal conduct
of one who in the utter privacy of his own heart is meditating whether to engage in a marriage or of what to do
with a marriage in which he is engaged.

The foregoing discussion is intended to find application
in the thought of an individual who is making: actual decisions. Therefore a theory upon marriage values and
art values in marriage has been developed with a view to
maximum self-consistency. For that which at present
renders choices on matters of marriage difficult is a confusion of ideals, or the lack of any ideal which is adequate
and coherent in all its parts.

In matters of love it sometimes happens that a man
does not regard himself as a free agent, capable of making choices as a consequence of meditation. He pictures \[p.249\] himself rather as a chip in the stream, carried whithersoever it may be by forces beyond his control. He says
of his love affair that the very force and pressure of his
love compels him to seek marriage, leaving no other alternative or he thinks of his marriage that his total fund
of prejudice and attitude is so disposed toward it that it
is impossible for him to continue it.

Since he is acting as the plaything of blind forces,
ideals would be a useless encumbrance to him. They
might serve him indeed to measure the height to which
he has risen or the depth to which he has fallen, but they
could not aid him in controlling his fate because he is
not trying to control it. Only the man who is seeking to
govern his destiny by means of his intelligence is in a
position to make use of this or any other theory of marriage.

Moreover, neither this system of marriage ideals nor
any other can present itself to his mind with utter and
absolute validity. It is only when a certain presupposition is accepted that a specific system of values unfolds. In this case the presupposition has been made
that marriage is essentially a personal relationship. The
specific values of marriage, loyalty value and duration
value, have been deduced from this assumption. If this
presupposition is accepted, then and then only do the
principles of marriage as herein outlined come into play
to serve the individual who is making the choice.

Therefore, as another fundamental choice, the individual must decide whether he is to consider his marriage
problem as if marriage were essentially a personal relationship. If he decides in the negative, choosing to
regard his marriage as essentially a socially useful institu\[p.250\]tion or a heaven-decreed duty, then he can make no practical use of the principles here laid down.

If he accepts the hypothesis that marriage is essentially a personal relationship, he will acknowledge the
validity of the system of values that is deduced therefrom. He accepts, for instance, the standard of domestic
excellence which accounts as best that family which
maintains most durably the highest level of domestic
interaction.

The use that is to be made of this system of values or
ideals depends upon the nature of the decision in hand:
whether it is the question confronting the unmarried or
the married.

The unmarried person is concerned with the problem
whether he should marry or not. He must acknowledge
that so far as he is concerned the critical question is
whether he is willing to commit himself to a permanent,
personal, paramount loyalty. This is not an arbitrary
question, raised whimsically like the question of blondes
versus brunettes. It is the necessary question which lies
at the threshold of all careful thinking on a marriage
problem.

The question of loyalty poses itself in more general
forms. For there are loyalties which are not paramount,
and paramount loyalties which are not personal, and
paramount personal loyalties which do not endure.

A paramount loyalty is desirable as an instrument of
the integrity of the self. For conduct in which the sell is
most clearly manifested, that is to say purposive conduct,
is subject to an hierarchy of purposes or ends. That which
is an end with respect to an inferior series of acts is a
means with respect to a superior series. The person who \[p.251\] has a mind so ordered that the hierarchy of his purposes
is dominated by a supreme purpose or paramount loyalty
is at peace with himself. His energies do not cancel each
other out in internal tensions. Therefore there is a value
to any one under all circumstances in having an object
of paramount loyalty.

This object need not be personal. One can fill his life
with an impersonal loyalty to Socialism, to the Church,
to Prohibition, to the Fatherland. Or one may accept
tentatively some object of paramount loyalty, leaving it
to the future to decide whether he will retain it or not.
Thus in the general range of choice that lies before a
man, the loyalty requirement of marriage is highly specialized.

The man who desires to commit himself to the special
kind of attitude that marriage requires may still be in
doubt whether his present will can effectively project
itself into an indefinite future. Unforeseen circumstances
may put an end to the state which he intends to be permanent, or set before him something which transcends in
value that which he has purposed to regard as supremely
valuable. In committing himself to a loyalty that is at
once paramount, personal and permanent, he may fear
that the commitment may be subject to change by factors not under his control.

It is here that introspection must run when one is testing his own mind to determine whether it is adequately
prepared for marriage. It is not to be expected that this
introspection is infallible, nor that it will eliminate risk,
but at least it will focus attention upon the facts that
are most significant with reference to the probable excellence of the marriage that is to be undertaken. 

\[p.252\] This is not the traditional diagnostic of love. These
are not the signs which Shakespeare listed --

> . . . the lover,  
Sighing like a furnace, with a woeful ballad  
Made to his mistress' eyebrow.

whereby the premarital state is to be identified. It does
not have much place in our romantic tradition that one
should order his mind upon his love affair by asking
himself: "Do I take her up as my permanent hobby?"
This is none the less the essential question of courtship;
its importance is implicit in the hypothesis that marriage
is a personal relationship.

The person who is already married finds a different
type of problem confronting him: at most he may be
wondering whether to maintain the marriage or terminate
it; at least he is concerned to know at what level of
domestic interaction to maintain the marriage.

Speaking and acting for himself alone he has only a
limited control over the level upon which his family is to
function. If his partner is domestically active, it rests
with him to determine whether he will give or withhold
his cooperation, and hence he has the option of choosing
any level from the unilateral to the romantic. But if his
partner is domestically inert, and fails to cooperate, then
his latitude of choice is limited He has only to decide
whether he will maintain single-handed a unilateral level
of domestic interaction, or give up the game and run the
relationship on a strictly exchange basis, on the economic
level. It will rest with him then to adapt his practice of
the art of marriage to the level upon which the family is
functioning. 

\[p.253\] If he undertakes to maintain paramount loyalty toward
his marriage partner, despite the fact that it is not reciprocated, and to act domestically though he receives
neither appreciation nor benevolence, he must assimilate
the relationship to that of a parent to a child, from whom
one exacts neither appreciation nor benevolent activity.
This is the consequence of functioning upon the unilateral
level.

The limitations of the marriage partner, the inertness,
the unresponsiveness, is then a challenge to art. For
just as the parent seeks to lead the child to take a more
responsive part in their relationship, so the husband or
wife seeks to increase the domestic qualities of the marriage partner, in order that the level of domestic interaction may be raised.

Under these conditions the most open activity takes
the form of histrionics, preferably, for it is by increasing
one's value to the other that one stimulates greater appreciation and loyalty. Pedagogics must be subtle and contention must never overstrain the loyalty that exists. The
object of contention must be not the winning of an argument but the creation of a satisfactory episode. This
means that perfect control is necessary. In the creating
of shared experiences, one person alone can do much; in
controlling their place in the stream of experiences he
can do even more, for he can forget the things that are
to be consigned to oblivion and remind the other of
the things that are to be remembered. And in all this,
one must seek an artist's satisfaction in a task well
done.

This is the pattern of art to be followed by those who
seek to raise the level of domestic interaction; but one \[p.254\] may prefer to let the marriage drift on the economic level.
In the latter case one makes no effort to raise the level
of excellence, but sets out rather to live one's own life
and to be as comfortable as conditions permit. He commits nothing to the marriage and hence is incapable of
losing much by it. If in the turn of events it comes
about that the marriage becomes too disadvantageous, it
is allowed to lapse. No significant development of personality issues from such a marriage; no deep sympathy
develops the self, nor do adequate conflicts teach adaptation. Quarrels are avoided not for histrionic or pedagogic
reasons, but in sheer indifference to considerations of
personality and in order to avoid annoyance. Self-development goes unnourished by sympathy; adaptation,
taking place without consummated conflict, is of the surface only. For these reasons the marriage on the economic level bears a superficial resemblance to the marriage on the romantic level, but it lacks depth, and is at
the mercy of circumstances. The problem it presents to
the individual is simple -- to get as much and give as little
as possible.

The individual acting alone has then alternatives of
these kinds before him. If the question is whether to
marry or not, he searches himself for his answer to the
problems of loyalty. If he finds that he is willing to
commit himself fully, then his is the optimum attitude
for marriage. If the question is what to do with a marriage already on his hands, he alone, on his own responsibility, can at least decide whether to carry on the family
life on the unilateral or economic level.

If he finds that he is not willing to commit himself to
an adequate loyalty then his reasons for marrying lie \[p.255\] somewhere off the level of the principles of marriage.
Perhaps it is a matter of sex experiment, or conformity
to convention, or economic advantage; these are reasons
to be weighed on a different scale. Nor is it to be expected that a marriage entered upon for such reasons will
yield much value as marriage unless a change of attitude
takes place.

And if he chooses the economic rather than the unilateral level of domestic interaction (this choice being of
course the only one that is absolutely within his power)
then he voluntarily surrenders whatever domestic value
might be accessible to him. The question whether to
continue or terminate the marriage is then removed to
another plane, where one reckons up costs and profits on
a balance sheet.

But can one ever get away from this thing of reckoning up costs and profits on a balance sheet? Is not the
very issue between choosing domestic values or rejecting
them a matter to be weighed by the mind in terms of its
advantages and disadvantages? And what after all is
the advantage to the individual it he reaches for domestic
values rather than other values? It is senseless to raise
the question of happiness in sheer quantitative form, to
ask whether domestic values will ultimately yield a
greater sum of satisfaction. For matters of happiness
are more intelligibly analyzed in terms of quality than of
quantity. And hence the individual puts his query in this
form: What is the particular kind of satisfaction that lies
before me if I choose to strive for domestic values? Why
should I prefer these to others? Why should I make the
domestic man an ideal of my life?

This query submits the marriage ideal to a new test. \[p.256\] It would be absurd, within the scope of this essay, to
claim for it any absolute preëminence over other ideals
of life. For it is not purposed here to outline a comprehensive ethic. All that a theory of this kind can do is to
show what things hang together, and what the full implication may be if one accepts or rejects marriage values
as an object of life. Hence the need for coherence and
consistency in the principles of marriage.

The theories of marriage values and of art values in
marriage have a superficial appearance of inconsistency,
for they are differently derived. The concepts of loyalty
value and duration value were deduced from the fundamental assumption that marriage is a personal relationship. The scheme of art values was developed by analogy
of marriage with other arts. The world of marriage
values is a world of purpose and intention. To intend
well is to do well in terms of marriage values, but not
in terms of art. The domestic man may be a bad artist;
his intentions may always fall short of achievement, and
for all that he is none the less the domestic man. The two
theories delineate different standards of excellence. The
symmetrical level of domestic interaction is the highest
standard of family life according to the scheme of
marriage value, whereas successful marriage art is to
be judged not by levels of intention and behavior in
the family but by stages in the development at personality.

Art value is thus individualistic; marriage value is not.
But marriage values are necessary preconditions to the
attainment of the highest art value. The reward which
the individual receives for an enduring loyalty to another
is a higher development of his own personality. The \[p.257\] man who stands alone, facing the issues of marriage,
reckons then in terms at the contribution marriage will
make to his own personality. Anything else is false
reckoning.

Perhaps it follows from this that marriage is not the
best of the alternatives that lie before one. Undoubtedly
many adults, both wedded and single, are seeking in marriage for values extraneous thereto, and many are by
their training unfitted to appreciate the actual marriage
values. Yet it is only fair, since marriage has been rather
relentlessly exposed, to demand that the complete consequences of alternatives to marriage should be equally
laid open. What are, then, the full implications as a life
object of personal ambition, the pursuit of pleasure, or
the purposeless contemplation of things? If these alternative life ideals are scrutinized with the care which has
been given to scrutinizing the ideal of marriage, their
apparent adequacy to fill a life may rapidly dissolve
away.

The purpose of this essay is accomplished, however,
without pursuing these questions. The two authors have
not been minded to set up as counselors of mankind.
They have wished only to trace out comprehensively the
implications of certain lines of thought that seemed to
come upon them out of nature itself. For if marriage
is the kind of thing they think it is, then these are its
implicit principles. Further than that, they make no
presumptions.

And if the language of domestic theory has been at
times repellant because of words that come with unkindly
flavor to English speech, this has been a sacrifice in the
interests of intellectual adequacy -- in order that issue \[p.258\] might be joined with other theories. Need it be said that
the principles of marriage are practiced in family life, regardless of how they are stated? They do not need to
be stated in order to be true.
