## Chapter X: The Domestic View of Human Nature

WHEN two young things promise to love and to
cherish one another, they take for granted the
existence in human nature of a capacity for loving and
cherishing. And each as regards the other is chiefly interested in that; one aspect of the other's nature. Will he
love me always? How much does he love me now?
These perennial questions reveal the natural form which
the thought of the newly married assumes. It is a sound
intuition which fixes upon this quality of human nature
as the most important in connection with domestic problems This quality is so worthy of special study that we
will give it a special name. We will call it the psychological equipment of the domestic man (*homo domesticus*).

The social sciences have adopted a convenient method
for studying the general effect of any given trait in human nature. They create for purposes of inquiry a fictitious man whose psychological endowment consists of
just such qualities as are pertinent to their investigation.
The most distinguished of these creations is, of course,
the economic man (*homo oeconomicus*) who knows only
the motives of self-interest and whose intellect is able to
measure with incredible exactness the intensity of all of
his desires. Less well known is the political man, whom
Catlin presents to us. The intelligence testers have \[p.102\] brought forth a psychological man whose nature is completely revealed in the answers he gives to lists of prepared questions. No careful thinker makes the mistake
of confounding these abstractions with the facts of nature.
It is perfectly apparent that a real man is neither the
economic abstraction of pure self-interest nor the political
abstraction of pure will to dominion nor the psychological
abstraction of pure "intelligence." Yet these abstractions
are useful, and we would not know what to do without
them. Taken together, they constitute a little menagerie
of fabulous beasts. Into this interesting and useful
menagerie it is permissible to introduce a new creature -- the domestic man, whose sole quality of mind and heart
is an ability to love and to cherish.

What is meant by loving and cherishing? What are
these qualities which we deem so important in the life of
the family?

The kind of account we will give of these qualities depends upon whether we confine our attention to their conscious manifestations or try to trace them back to some
unconscious process out of which they can be said to
arise. Since the object of formulating these principles of
marriage is to establish a pattern for conscious purposive
conduct, these qualities must be studied in their conscious
form, although their derivation from nonconscious elements may be recognized.

They derive from two primitive and beautiful attitudes -- the attitude of a male and female toward each other as
their lives are joined in a new life, and the attitude of the
protecting parent toward a dependent child. Both of
these love-attitudes enter into the character of the domestic man. 

\[p.103\] When these primitive love-attitudes are interpreted
according to the requirements of a religious cult, a social
code, or an intellectual interest, many variant conceptions
of love result -- there is for instance the disembodied
"pure" love which derives from the worship of the Virgin, the love-service ideal of medieval chivalry, and Platonic love which expresses itself in the contemplation of
an ideal.

These variants of the love concept are products of a
certain amount of sophistication and discipline. They do
not flow directly from natural impulse. We cannot witness their analogues in the behavior of the higher animals.
They represent special qualities of love in a given time
and place and not the universal quality of love everywhere. They describe aspects of culture or civilization
rather than aspects of human nature. They always
threaten to cause a misunderstanding of the real nature
of love, and to establish in hierarchic order a series of
different kinds of love, from love of the body to love of
the soul.

The distinction between "sacred" and "profane" love,
between pure love and animal passion, between natural
love and sophisticated love, is a dangerous distinction to
introduce into marriage. It is a distinction unknown to
the domestic man. And yet it is often introduced, in the
Western World, under the influence of the Puritan tradition. The psychoanalysts describe it as a dissociation
phenomenon in which the sex aspect of love is dissociated
from the tenderness aspect.

It is a distinction which can do no good at all, but
which can work infinite harm. There is always plenty of \[p.104\] ways, but no beautiful love relationship between man and
wife can be based on the repression or contempt of
sex.

Love can be spiritual if it does not denounce the flesh or
regard the body as unclean; it can rise to great heights
of beauty if it does not destroy its own foundations in
nature. A bride who thinks of loving and cherishing as
something ethereal, and of sex as something vile, must
either change her mind or endanger her marriage. Most
of them, according to Dr. Hamilton, change their minds.
The real and important distinction which must be made
by lovers is the distinction between personal and impersonal love. The impersonal love for mankind which
Christian ethics requires is the antithesis of the personal love which marriage demands. Humanitarianism,
brotherly love, altruism, philanthropy -- all these sentiments are rivals and even enemies of the jealous personal attachment which draws two lovers together. The
oft recurrent tragedy of the man torn between love for
his family and devotion to a cause is evidence of the
wide disparity between these two kinds of loving and
cherishing.

The capacity to love and to cherish which we ascribe
to domestic man is necessarily an aptitude for personal
rather than impersonal devotion. This is logically implied in the definition of the family as something that
consists of determinate members, and in the description
of the relationship of personality which unites the members of a family. Quite aside from formal logical requirements, the voices of all lovers would insist that this
and nothing else, is the special quality which they demand in their beloved. Loving and cherishing in domes\[p.105\]tic life is a personal affair, an outgrowth of the natural
functions of sex and parenthood.

This kind of loving and cherishing is at its source common to man and beast. It need not be expressed in words
nor formulated in thought. It is more primitive than
logic, and anterior even to consciousness. But when the
light of consciousness is thrown upon it and the schematization of logic is applied to it, it is very clearly a personal attitude. An ego is the source of object-love; a
person is its object.

Loving and cherishing, being acts that arise in one
person and are directed toward another, have both an
active and a passive aspect. They involve motives on the
one hand, and feelings on the other. The motives and
feelings are of a special type which must be assumed to
be present in the domestic man.

Just as it has been necessary to borrow from the social
sciences in analyzing various aspects of the family, so
now it is appropriate to make use of psychological theory
in the domestic view of human nature. It is necessary
here to defend the idea that the domestic man's behavior
proceeds from motion and then to classify and analyze
the motives from which it proceeds.

In a period of intellectual adventure and experiment,
such as the present, there comes a time when service can
be done by stating emphatically facts that are perfectly
obvious and insisting categorically upon the recognition
of truths that are already accepted. In this spirit it is
appropriate to assert that there are such things as motives
and purposes, and that human behavior is sometimes motivated or purposive. This is a view so much in accord
with our commonsense interpretation of things that some \[p.106\] psychologists regard it as a perversely unsophisticated
notion.

Psychologists object to motives because there is no
experimental proof that a motive corresponds to any psychophysical fact; what we call motive may be merely
afterthought, or, as they say, "rationalization". This objection would be regarded as mere pettifogging if motives
could be measured exactly or analyzed statistically. But
motives are notoriously ill-adapted for use as objects of
science. They have quality and quantity, but their quality cannot be reduced to any quantitative terms nor their
quantity measured on any known scale. Psychology lets
them go with a sigh of relief, for it suspects all introspective data. "Since the rise of the experimental method in
psychology there has been little if any room in the field
for the study of the human individual when he performs
what may be very definitely and accurately called purposive actions."[^10-1] Since Kantor wrote these lines, two
significant books on motives have appeared: Thomson's
*Springs of Human Action* (1927) and Troland's *Fundamentals of Human Motivation* (1928). Thomson is
clearly a pioneer in the analysis of these things; Troland's
work is more thorough.

There are other fields of thought from which the concept of motive cannot be dismissed so easily. If we are
trying to get human behavior into a rational system such
as ethics or law, not attempting to correlate it with a
physiological or sociological process, then the existence
of motives must be assumed; otherwise ethical systems
and codes of criminal law are irrational.

[^10-1]: R. Kantor, *Principles of Psychology* (Alfred A. Knopf, New
	York, 1924), Vol. 1., p. 129. 

\[p.107\] And yet it is clear that not all behavior is motivated.
Thomson uses "motive" to mean all factors moving to
conduct, but most writers use the term to mean a conscious and purposive element in the determining of behavior. "Motivated behavior belongs to that most complicated of all behavior modes . . . in which the person
is not only a part of the stimulus reaction but the main
stimulus." (Kantor.) To illustrate: In the ordinary reflex action situation the stimulus is external, as light striking the eye, but in motivated behavior the principal
stimulus is the total personality of the actor, as when
Napoleon decides to return from Elba. It would be a
grotesque description of Napoleon's decision if we should
say that the arrival of newspapers from France at Elba
operated to bring about the departure of Napoleon from
exile in the same way that the light striking the eye operates to contract the pupil. Kantor lists in hierarchic
order five modes of action as follows:

> 1. Automatic (Actions not remembered, anaesthesia, stupor, coma, etc.)
> 2. Subreactionalistic (Individual concentrated on stimulus but action not 
	sharply pointed; habit reactions often in this class.)
> 3. Reactionalistic (This includes the "flash of genius"
	type of behavior.)
> 4. Subpersonalistic (This includes the reactions of the
	person as represented by his likes,
	tastes, abilities, etc.)
> 5. Personalistic ("Whenever there is some problem
	of advantage or disadvantage"; all
	motivated or purposive behavior.) 

\[p.108\] The intimate connection between motives on the one
hand and personality on the other is attested in Occidental thinking whenever human behavior is ascribed to
"social forces" rather than to the agency of an individual
person. When action is not attributed to a person, the
motive concept drops away. The Samoans, according to
Miss Mead,[^10-2] do not possess any well defined concept of
motive. Their social habits do not allow them to inquire
and their language does not permit them to speak concerning the motives of any one in doing anything. The
absence of a motive-concept implies a distinctive
attitude toward personality. A Samoan love does
not engage the personalities of its participants. Very deeply,
and even as between husband and wife, a deep personal
attachment is regarded as indecent. Needless to say, the
natural family is quite submerged in the Samoan kinship
and village organization. Thus the ethnologist, the psychologist, and the student of the family arrive at the same
truth from different points of view. The psychologist
notes that the behavior which most completely engages a
personality in action is motivated behavior. The ethnologist notes that the motive concept, the personality value
and the natural family unit are linked elements in a culture; the student of the family discovers that motives are
important in domestic life because they testify to the
engaging of a complete personality therein -- because they
are part of the psychological equipment of the domestic
man.

[^10-2]: Margaret Mead, *Coming of Age in Samoa* (William Morrow, New
	York, 1928). 

In normal experience motives are, as we say, "mixed."
We are seldom able to pin them down and identify them
\[p.109\] with certainty. As Thomson rightly complains, they are
numerous, elusive, complex, varied, and locking in constancy. And yet, without insisting unduly upon the naturalistic accuracy of our conception, we describe motives
as having both quantity and quality. Having quantity
(or intensity), they are capable of being added to or subtracted from each other, having quality, they are capable of being grouped or clustered in various ways. The
problem of classifying motives does not differ fundamentally from all problems of classification. A thousand
individuals be they beetles or poems, verbs or motives,
will continue to present individual differences whether we
group them or not. In order to group them we must assign classificatory significance to certain of their features,
disregarding others.

The motive which is peculiar to loving-and-cherishing
behavior is a motive of benevolence toward the person
who is loved. The domestic man intends his acts to
benefit his beloved rather than himself. It is permissable,
therefore, to classify as domestic those motives which
direct behavior toward the welfare of some definite other
person, and to regard all other motives as nondomestic.
The domestic motive is the distinctive characteristic
which marks the active aspect of loving and cherishing.
Just as the economic man is perfectly selfish, so the domestic man is perfectly unselfish.

The distinction between selfishness and unselfishness is
a dubious one, but we cannot explain the nature of the
domestic man without expounding it. One of the first
signs of sophistication in a college student is his grasp
of a certain formula for calculating motives whereby he
can prove that all acts whatsoever are selfishly motivated. 
\[p.110\] The philanthropist and the miser, the patriot and the
city boss, the loving daughter and the faithless wife are
all alike selfish. Even the martyr who seems to be
sacrificing himself is, according to this formula, giving
himself the satisfaction of martyrdom. This current
sophistry impresses tender minds, but after all it amounts
to nothing but a word trick. If we define "selfishness"
in such a way that it corresponds to "preference," then
we can argue that whatever is decided upon is preferred,
and whatever is preferred is preferred by a self, and
hence is selfishly preferred. When this little logism has
been played through, it is still necessary to distinguish
between certain kinds of "selfish" actions. If some actions are intended to minister to the needs or increase
the happiness of others, such actions can be classified
together, whether the word "unselfish" is used to describe them, or not. Actions of this kind flow naturally
from a disposition to love and to cherish. Nature has
equipped husband and wife to delight each other in the
act of sex, and has prepared the parent to minister to
the needs of the child. Thereby nature sets up prototypes
for the activities of a domestic man.

The activity which we have for the moment described
as "unselfish" would be regarded by many thinkers as
a perverse and intricate kind of selfishness. For the
kind of conduct which results from a personal attachment occupies a very uncertain place in the speculations
of social theorists. In economics unselfishness of any
kind is an anomaly; in sociology and political theory it
is comprehended only as group-loyalty, which submerges \[p.111\] these theories except as a special form of self-seeking.
If a governor appoints his son to some high office, despite
the fact that some other candidate was better qualified,
economic theory sees this act as an economic act wherein
the governor drew some of the invisible wages of his
office by securing something he desired for himself -- *i.e.,*
his son's appointment. In political theory it might be
pointed out that the governor had two capacities: the
capacity of a public official and the capacity of a father.
In making this appointment the governor permitted the
father to act outside of his proper sphere. A personal
motive interfered with the discharge of a public duty.
It would not be asked whether the personal motive was
self-regarding or other-regarding. The personal motive
would be regarded necessarily as a selfish motive. And
if, in order to protect his son, the governor would ruin
his own political prospects, or risk imprisonment, these
sacrifices would still be regarded from the point of view
of economics or political theory as risks selfishly assumed.
If a man gives up everything he has in order to save
his wife or child, it is regarded as selfish. In such a
context the word "selfish" loses its meaning.

If these acts are seen from the standpoint of the family,
from the point of view of those persons who benefit by
them, they appear to be unselfish. The governor is acting
as a domestic man. A sacrifice of a father for a son
is an evidence of loving and cherishing. Favoritism and
nepotism look selfish from without the family, but unselfish from within. The acts in themselves are neither
selfish nor unselfish; the antithesis between selfishness
and unselfishness lies not in nature, which is ethically
blind, but in the set of principles and presuppositions \[p.112\] which we use in classifying acts. This is evident when
we compare the plausibility of the sociological and the
economic explanations at human behavior. For almost
all conduct can be referred in sociological theory to an
other-regarding movement of the mind, in economic theory to a self-regarding movement. The two diverse explanations of the same act can be made equally plausible
and are in fact equally true.

For example, let us say that a woman is buying a hat.
On her way she passes a curio shop, where many strange
articles are displayed. She gives only a passing glance
at the richly gleaming articles in the window, and passes
on to the milliner's where she buys a hat. Explain this
by economic theory: she had a certain quantity of desire
for the hat which was greater than her desire for the
strange ornaments. She satisfied her selfish desire. Explain it by sociological theory: she was sensitive to the
fact that other people approved of the wearing of hats,
but not of the wearing of showy jewelry. A maiden from
Basutoland would for similar reasons have passed by
the millinery shop and purchased a fine nose ring in the
curio shop. Now let us suppose that we explain her
conduct with reference to the family and to her capacity
for loving and cherishing. We can say that she wished
to please her husband by making herself more attractive,
to give him greater cause for pride in her. None of
these explanations are complete; any of them may be
transposed into the language of the others; the value
of any of them depends upon the importance of the
general conclusions we can reach by making use of them.

The overt action which proceeds from a domestic motive is a distinctive kind of behavior, which should have \[p.113\] a definite name. It may be called benevolent activity,
or perhaps (if the words are understood in a special
sense), a domestic act. It is perhaps the kind of thing
we mean when we use the words "to cherish". It is a
fundamental element of that interaction between members
which the structure of the natural family implies. It is
a vehicle wherein the separate will of a member of the
family finds expression, and hence it is a manifestation
of the basic *will-tension* of marriage. It is productive
of the intrinsic *values* of family life.

The distinction between domestic and nondomestic motivation is of course merely conceptual. There is in
nature no hard and fast classification of motives. In
practical life motives are mixed. The woman who is
putting her hair in curl papers is actuated partly by a
domestic motive: to please her husband or lover and
partly by a nondomestic (or economic) motive: to satisfy
her personal vanity. How much of a component of
domestic motivation is necessary in order that an act
may be regarded as domestic?

Psychologists who remember the extravagances of sensationist psychology with its classification of subjective
data will be prejudiced against the use of such a scheme
as this which is here set forth. It is so easy to draw up
catalogues of emotions or sensations or desires or instincts; so many of these catalogues are meaningless.
An arbitrary list of types of motive would have no value
if we were trying to study psychology, but it is necessary
when we are studying the family. It brings before us
the distinctions which may or may not be real in the
human organism, but which are certainly real in the
business of family life. \[p.114\] It is certainly both futile and impossible to name a
quantity of domestic motivation which invests acts with
domestic character. The domestic or nondomestic character of an act is clearly manifested only in certain situations of suspense, when rival interests are hanging in the
balance. In such situations it is a matter of no consequence how the components of motivation be added or
subtracted, so long as the domestic motive prevails. The
domestic component need be neither great nor small; it
need only be sufficient, that is to say, sufficient to turn
the balance in favor of an act which benefits the marriage
partner rather than the self or some other interest.

There is a simple pro-condition of benevolent activity
which can he described in the words "paramount loyalty,"
or "preponderant interest." The domestic man always
deems the welfare of his marriage partner to be a matter of highest value to him. Any conflicting interest
which comes to his attention will be subordinated to this
preponderating interest. This does not mean that he
must, like Annabel Lee,

> Live with no other thought  
> Than to love and be loved by me.  

His thoughts need not dwell perpetually upon the welfare
of his mate. There may be innumerable choices and decisions in which her welfare is in nowise engaged. It is
not necessary that domestic acts should always be sacrificial acts. It is only necessary that when an interest in
a member of one's family is in direct conflict with other
interests the former must prevail.

If a man values his club or his business more highly
than his family, there is something wrong with his family \[p.115\] life. Circumstances may compel him to be more persistently and assiduously occupied with outside affairs,
but our common-sense view of things demands that except in some exceptional situation the interest of the
members of the family should predominate when it comes
to a showdown. If the wife's health demands they move
to Arizona, the husband must sacrifice his business in
New York. This personal evaluation which seems so
natural within the family appears out of place or mischievous outside of the domestic circle. As we have observed, it is known as favoritism or nepotism in the
domain of business or politics. But in family life it is
normal and good. There are a number of situations in
which ethical theory requires that the interest of a member of one's family be sacrificed to some other interest,
but there is no pretense that such situations are norms of
domestic conduct. Should one member of a family perjure himself for another? It is understood that such
situations are exceptional, just as martyrdom is exceptional, and that they interfere with the functioning of the
family.

Paramount loyalty is thus seen to be the subjective
prerequisite of domestic activity, and a distinctive endowment of the domestic man. It is a mental act or sentiment by which the welfare of some one else is evaluated
as having greater importance than the welfare of any
other person or the attainment of any conflicting aim
which may be simultaneously present to the mind. Value-begetting attachments of this kind are, of course, at once
conscious and emotional. If they were unconscious, the
psychoanalysts would call them complexes. Paramount
loyalty, being conscious, is called a sentiment or 
"con\[p.116\]stellation," not a complex. It is the key to the psychological make-up of the domestic man. Briefly, the domestic man is a hypothetical person who, though normal
in other respects, is abnormal with respect to his personalistic mode of behavior. Instead of balancing a
variety of conflicting interests when he decides questions
of advantage or disadvantage, he refers all these questions to one final standard -- the welfare of his domestic
partner. Real men approach this quality of mind to a
greater or less degree. The domestic man is a fiction, and
being a fiction can be also an ideal.

There are some who think that a life lived for another
person is necessarily a satisfactory life, that even if such
a life does not bring apparent happiness, still it yields
obscure satisfactions which are all the more profound and
intense because they are concealed. It is a mistake to
preach such an immediate connection between benevolent
activity and happiness. Unskillful cherishing may be
more disastrous to happiness than enlightened selfishness.
There is no absolute superiority in *homo domesticus* over
*homo oeconomicus* or any other ideal man. It is only relative to the life of the family that the domestic man offers
a more appropriate ideal of conduct than others.

In the family as elsewhere there is unlimited scope for
artistry and science. There is an art in the planning of
a surprise and science in the planning of a meal. A cultivated aesthetic sense can express itself in anything from
a coat of paint on the kitchen table to an artistically
managed quarrel which melts away in delicious tears of
reconciliation. Applications of scientific knowledge are
possible all along the line: the husband's bad temper can
be cured if the wife knows about orange juice and vitamin \[p.117\] C; the wife's coldness can be overcome if the husband
will watch the periodicity of the moon. The domestic
man may be ignorant of all the important things, and his
life may be tragically unhappy because of his ignorance.
The domestic man as such may be neither wise nor happy,
and none the less be continuously domestic. The distinction between domestic and nondomestic does not parallel
the distinction between wisdom and folly, welfare and
misery, happiness and discontent. Domesticity and its
opposite are the poles of an independent series of values.

For illustration, let us imagine a crisis in the life of a
young family. George and Dorothy have been living in
a one-room apartment for two years while George has
tried to launch himself as a commercial artist, and
Dorothy has helped out by working at Macy's department store. George is thinking that the time has come
to give up his plans and get into some business which will
yield more money for Dorothy. Dorothy fights grimly to
keep on because she is afraid that he will not be happy
in the insurance business, and she insists that she is glad
to go on working and doing the cooking over a gas jet in
the bathroom if George will only keep on with his art.
This is clearly a case of domestic behavior.

On another floor of the some cheap apartment house
another young couple is in equal misery, but in this case
the wife is complaining that she is sick of living in one
room, while the husband laments that his chances of success are being ruined by her demands. These two situations are externally parallel, but from the domestic point
of view there is a world of difference between them. We
do not know on the facts as given which of the two situations is most painful, but we do know that they unfold \[p.118\] themselves on different levels. One is domestic, the other
nondomestic. The difference between them is not a difference of degree but a difference of kind.

This difference in kind between a domestic and a nondomestic situation has long been taught to our young
people. The older generation has repeatedly assured the
younger generation that marriage will give life more
depth, more fullness. The language in which this message is preached borrows phrases from religion on the
one hand and from the literature of romance on the other.
Especially the word *love* serves at once to describe and
to explain the deeper life which marriage makes possible.
George and Dorothy love each other, whereas the other
young couple do not love each other! The explanation is
so simple that it leaves us where we were at the beginning,
with our vague schoolgirl faith in true love. It leaves us
with the blank question still before us, whether this or
that kind of love is to be a possibility in our own lives.
Love explains nothing, but is itself a thing that needs to
be explained.

Nowhere in our thinking is the survival of faith in
primitive word magic more apparent than in our use of
the word love. Let a woman be rude, captious, complaining, jealous, and mean to a man, and if it is only said
that she acts that way out of love for him, the word is
held to change the color of her actions. Just as some
states require that an internal revenue stamp must be
affixed to a certain class of documents, so some customs
require that a declaration of love must in decency accompany a certain class of proposals. The potency is in the
word rather than in any one specific thing to which the
word refers, for the word covers a multitude of different \[p.119\] attitudes. It can be traced through a maze of contradictory meanings. For instance: the home requires love;
love is essentially free; free love breaks up the home.
It can be applied indiscriminately to contrary kinds of
behavior, as any movie plot will demonstrate. If the man
seduces the virgin, it is because he loves her, and if he
refrains from seducing her it may also be because of his
love for her.

In another of the stock situations of drama the woman
loves the man but believes that her love will harm him.
Then if she renounces him, this is due to her great love,
but if she still clings to him this is also due to her love.
Love blows either hot or cold; whatever she does she does
for love. It is another case of word magic.

But when we speak of a domestic motive, of preponderant interest, or of paramount loyalty, we bring before
our minds something which has a more precise and unequivocal meaning. If this woman's attitude is domestic,
that is to say, if her interest in the man's welfare looms
larger in her life than anything else, then she renounces
him. This very attitude is indeed one of the many things
which are by some people called love. It happens to be
the one which is of greatest importance in family life In
insisting on its importance we do not disparage any of
the other varieties or manifestations of lover. Least of all
do we contend that love is any less significant than it is
generally held to be. We mean simply that love as a word
refers to many different things which have different kinds
and degrees of importance in marriage.

What are these different meanings which the word love
has accumulated and the different points of view from
which it is regarded? There is first the notion that by \[p.120\] love we mean bare sex life. A book on "love in nature"
tells us about the mating habits of frogs and lizards.
Sharing this point of view but lending to it an artistic
interest are those who, like Ovid or Havelock Ellis, see
love as an art based on sex, an art which finds in sex life
its principal medium of expression. Others like Edgar
Saltus in his *Historia Amoris* think of love as a texture
of social conventions about sex life. They compare love
in Greek times when there were heterae and temples of
Aphrodite with love in medieval Europe when there were
tourneys and courts of love, and with love in our own day
when there are movies and coeducational universities.
Freud dips into his deep sea of the unconscious and drags
forth Narcissine love, which attaches to a projection of
the self, and object love, which attaches to a complement
to the self.

There are some metaphysicians who see in love a universal principle of nature. Empedocles said it was the
principle of attraction; Schopenhauer declared it was the
life force. Far more numerous are those who describe
or classify love experiences, whether their own or other
people's. Frances Newman's "hard boiled virgin" felt
love as a fountain playing within her somewhere in the
region of the navel. Others have seemed to feel it as
something resembling fire rather than water. Some
writers try to classify all the different feelings which can
be called love. Stendhal found that love is of four kinds:
passion-love, body-love, spirit-love, vanity-love. The new
school of German philosophy, the so-called "phenomenologists," attempts to define the subjective state with
rigorous methodical accuracy. Max Scheler, a leader of
this school, has worked out the following definition: "Love \[p.121\] is a movement from lower value to higher value in the
object loved." Some of these attitudes called love bear
very little relation to the functioning of the family. Don
Juan was a lover, but not a domestic man.

From the practical standpoint of courtship and marriage, the most confusing ambiguity in the meaning of the
word love results from its dual application to experience
of feeling on the one hand, and of purposing and evaluating on the other. Many of those who describe a love
experience present it to us as something that seizes upon
us while we remain more or less passively subject to it.
It may come or it may go, as the foul weather follows
fair. While it lasts it bathes us in a glow of pleasure
which we enjoy but do not create. It beckons us with
more or less directness toward the possession of the beloved as the supreme goal of desire. In the language of
psychology this is a "feeling response" rather than a personalistic mode of behavior. It is something that happens
to one, not something that one does. It is an ultimate
datum of experience in which reason and purpose are not
present as components, and which is no more under the
control of the will than is the beating of one's heart.
Such a love as this is the natural basis at a liaison, but
not of marriage.

The love which marriage requires is more highly developed on the active and voluntary side. It seeks not
only to enjoy the beloved, but also to serve and benefit
her. This is the kind of love for which young people who
are thinking of marriage must search their hearts. In
order to avoid confusion we have given it a special name,
calling it the domestic attitude, or the sentiment of paramount loyalty. It you prefer to call it love, well and \[p.122\] good. It is intimately related to the feeling reaction of
love, for this feeling enters into it as a component, along
with reason and purpose. It is the kind of love of which
one can be master rather than slave. It is the kind of
love which is the necessary precondition of the functioning of the family, and which constitutes the psychological
equipment of the domestic man.

It is notorious that those who marry are prone to indulge themselves in transitory idealizations and to accept
temporarily the most fantastic fictions, so that many a
bride who pledges her truth to a more human being imagines that she is pledging it to none other than the
domestic man himself. The imagination of lovers long
ago invented this man; it is time that a place be made
for him in social theory and that the domestic view of
human nature be recognized in the social studies.
