JUST as the examination of *convention* revealed an
antithesis between family and society, so also an
analysis of *authority* clarifies the distinction between family and State.

Occidental families find that the problem of authority
in the home is already posed for them in the words of
the marriage service which require that one spouse promise to obey the other. The wedding customs of other
peoples may be less specific in referring to domination
of one partner over the other, but usually there is some
standard pattern of authority and subordination to which
families are expected to conform. But families do not
conform to these patterns. A strong-willed American
girl who has commanded her fiancÃ© in every crisis and
prevailed in every decision may promise as a matter of
form to obey him, but no one is misled by the promise,
least of all the husband and wife. Among primitive
peoples who consecrate the authority of the male with
all the machinery of rigorous custom at their command,
the women with their teasing and giggling and singing of pointed songs are far from being completely
dominated.

Can there be a definite allocation of authority in a
family organization? Folklore and table are full of the
discussion of this moot point. The situation in which \[p.79\] one spouse dominates while seeming to submit is an unfailing theme of humorous narrative.

There is for instance the anecdote of the philosopher
who set out to prove that throughout the whole country
no man was lord of his own household. He took with
him two horses, a gray and a bay, and gave out word
that to any man who was sole ruler at his home he
would freely give one of the horses as a reward. He
went from one farmstead to another, repeating his inquiry
and offer. Since these were simple, honest folk, the
husbands all told him truly that they were often checked
and governed by their wives and in this their wives confirmed them. Finally he encountered a canny farmer
who asserted that he alone was ruler in his house. His
wife, a sharp-faced woman, bore out his statement and
owned that it was the truth. Whereupon the philosopher told him to choose a horse, either the gray or
the bay.

The farmer looked the horses over carefully. "I think
I'll take the bay."

The philosopher began to untie the bay, and while
he was thus engaged the farmer talked in low tones to
his wife. Then, having spoken with her no more than
a moment, he called out to the philosopher, "Hold, sir,
I think I will take the gray." But the philosopher,
laughing, drove away with both horses, and returned
gladly to his home, having proved that which he had
set out to demonstrate.

Recently John Macy reported the results of a similar
amateur investigation. He had inquired of his married
friends whether in a crisis the husband or the wife prevailed. His friends were inclined to regard the question \[p.80\] as inconclusive if not actually foolish. His report bore
the stinging title, "The Two-Headed Monster, the
Family." From the point of view of one who seeks to
know definitely where authority resides, the family is
monstrous indeed.

But why should we wish to know where authority in
the family is centered? The question is one which implies that the family is a miniature State. It carries
over to the discussion of domestic affairs that doctrinaire
difficulty which attends the so-called juridical theory of
the State, namely, the search for sovereignty, for a supreme will-determining organ of the political group.

Kinship organizations are often political in character.
The community sometimes holds the head of a household
responsible for the conduct and debts of its members;
the laws of republican Rome gave to the *paterfamilias*
complete authority over the lives and property of his
descendants and their wives. It is noteworthy that the
kinship groups which have so strongly marked a political
character are usually larger than the natural family. In
any case, this aspect of the organization of the family
is only one of the many conventional characteristics which
society imposes on the family by means of pressure from
without, or introduces from within by inculcating ideals
of conduct. It is only as an institution, not as a fact
in nature, that the family has any standardized organization of authority. It is formally impossible for the State
to exist without sovereignty, but the family can lead a
vigorous life without making use of any will-determining
organ whatsoever.

Much of the life of the family goes on without the
making of corporate decisions. The husband may do \[p.81\] something of which the wife does not approve; the wife
may do something contrary to the husband's wishes.
Neither of them is expressing the collective will of the
family in his act. And yet his act is part of a complex of action which fills domestic life.

Certainly there are some questions which the family
must definitely decide, one way or the other. It is not
difficult to envisage the making of these decisions as if
it were a kind of political process. Here the father initiates a move and the mother has veto power; there the
supreme authority is a council in which the two eldest
children have a voice but no vote. F.P.A. printed in
his column in the New York *World* a political analysis
of a family campaign to buy a Buick sedan. Says the
father:

> "At a caucus of my faction held last night at dinner the situation was fraught with suspense. My wife, heroine of many
similar campaigns, indorsed the Huick, but my favorite son
Joe aligned himself with the irreconcilables. In his keynote
speech he demanded a Darmon."

> "Which way did your daughter Betty swing?"

> "She is in the doubtful column. Her sister Bab is also on
the fence. It is my youngest, Connie, who threw the bomb-shell into the convention. She was not expected to loom very
large on the horizon. But it seems now that she occupies a
pivotal position and I fear she may be a deciding factor in the
conflict. She is standing pat for an imported model."

> "The outlook is hardly encouraging."

> "Far from it. But I intend to marshal my forces. Betty
and Bab can be won over and instructed. That will give my
cohorts an overwhelming plurality. When Joe sees which way
the wind is blowing he will change his stand and lie low until
next year. Thus Connie will find herself the standardbearer
of a lost cause and will be forced to capitulate." \[p.82\] If the family existed primarily as an instrument for
formulating decisions upon matters of policy, the political-theory analysis of the domestic situation would be useful
and valid. If the principal problems of domestic life
were problems of deciding upon a common line of action,
then it would be obvious that the structure of the family
was ill-adapted for the solving of its problems, and John
Macy might fairly use the epithet "Two-Headed Monster" in writing of the family. It cannot be disputed
that the modern Occidental family is in fact two-headed,
but it is only from the specialized viewpoint of political
theory that this two-headedness is monstrous.

In our political way of thinking we attribute to the
State one single psychological quality -- a will. We regard
the State as an artificial person, endowed with volitional
unity, and equipped with a specialized organ or *sovereign*
which determines its will. The Crown in Parliament
expresses the will of the British State by making laws
and directing administrative policies.

But that a community of men are endowed with a
common will is perhaps more a fiction and a metaphor
than a description of objective truth. As Willoughby,
dean of American political theorists, concedes in his discussion of the *Fundamental Concepts of Public Law*,
this theory of the State "may start with any premise
that it is deemed useful to assume . . . an attempt to
examine their abstract validity would be as devoid of
meaning as to question whether it is correct to use *x* or *y*
to indicate the unknown quantity in an algebraic expression. . . . Analytical political philosophy does not
attempt the statement of metaphysically correct propositions. The essential juristic qualities which it predicates \[p.83\] of the State are not supposed to correspond to substantive
qualities which, ontologically speaking, inhere in the State
and in law."

There is no quarrel with the political theorists if they
find it useful to attribute a metaphysical common personality to the State. But it is clear that the family can
have no such unitary personality, to which a unitary
will can attach. For the family is made up of a number
of distinct and complete personalities which in the nature
of things cannot be merged.

If we think of an individual in one capacity only (for
example, his political capacity) then it is possible to
imagine that relative to that particular capacity or range
of activity there has been a merging of his will in some
larger will. But when we think of a complete personality, then such a merging of one will in another is
inconceivable and self-contradictory.

The wife who attempts to make complete submission
to her husband diminishes the personal character of her
marriage relationship. If it were psychologically possible
for her completely to annihilate her own will, or to merge
it in her husband's, her relationship with her husband
would cease to be a personal one. Such perfect self-effacement, however it be studied and pursued, can never
be achieved. But even to attempt its achievement is
monstrous and abnormal. The promise to obey in marriage, when seriously meant, intends not the suicide but
rather the dedication of a personality and will. The
tie of personality and the distinction of persons in marriage can be rendered less important (in so far as mechanical submission obtains), but it cannot be effaced.

It is in a sense paradoxical that the family, in which \[p.84\] the most complete intimacies of life are possible, should
none the less be so constituted that we must regard its
members as forever distinct in personality and will -- and hence forever in a state of tension. This is the
paradox which, as Keyserling has pointed out, makes of
marriage a fundamentally tragic situation.

Herein we discover the most profound difference between the domestic and the political conception of the
family. Whenever we are confronted with a number of
individual things and it is required that we grasp them
collectively, our minds reach at once for some metaphor
or symbol by which we can reduce the diversity to
unity, and envisage the many as one. So it is with the
many citizens of at State and with the separate members
of a family. The symbols which fulfill these purposes
in political theory are all of a type which involves the
merging of an aspect or capacity of individuals in a
higher metaphysical unity. There is the symbol of the
organism, which we establish by envisaging the individuals as organs having functions, and being defined by the
functions they perform; there is the symbol of sovereignty which we create by deducing from the unity of
a rational system of law the existence of a unitary and
rational lawgiver in whose being men as legal creatures
are merged, or before whom all bow down; there is also
the symbol of the group mind, which we form by inferring from observed similarities in the thoughts and feelings of many individuals the existence of some super-personal mind in the processes of which the individuals
participate, but with which they are not wholly identified.

We cannot use such symbols as these in envisaging
the unity of the family because the personality of the \[p.85\] family relationship makes them inapplicable.[^8-1] Count
Keyserling suggests that we conceive the unity of the
family by means of a more appropriate metaphor: the
elliptical field of force.

> . . . the life-form of marriage must possess a special and independent significance. Love, propagation and self-preservation can only act as components. Within its domain of
isolation the ego must be fundamentally secured. Such a conception of higher unity is actually realizable: *it corresponds exactly
with an elliptical field of force*. The latter has two loci which
are fixed and never can be merged in one another; its interpolar tension cannot be abolished if the field is to remain intact.
The interpolar tension is at the same time an independent
unit created by the field of force itself. This unit cannot
be deduced from the specific character of each pole, taken
separately or together, or from any other possible relation
existing between the two. In the very same sense marriage
represents an independent unit over and above each partner
and his particular impulse.[^8-2]

Keyserling's metaphor of *polarity*, used to define the
nature of the family, has this virtue: that it keeps clearly
before us the fact that personalities cannot be merged.
The writer who describes the family as a "two-headed
monster" was unconsciously presenting to us not a faulty
or accidental character of a debased or disorganized
family but the essential and universal character of the
family in all times. The separateness of the spouses is
an excellence, not a blemish, in married life. In the
\[p.86\] words which Kahlil Gibran's Prophet addressed to husbands and wives:

[^8-1]: The logical difficulty of conceiving of complete persons as members
of a collective unity has been explored in the theological discussion of
the Trinity, which requires of us that we think of the Trinity without
"confusing the persons nor confounding the substance."

[^8-2]: Count Hermann Keyserling, *The Book of Marriage* (Harcourt,
Brace, New York, 1926), p. 8. 

> . . . Let there be spaces in your togetherness  
And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.  
Love one another, but make not a bond of love:  
Let it be rather a moving sect between the shores of your souls.  
Fill each other's cup but drink not from the same cup.  
Give one another your bread but eat not from the same loaf.  
Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each or you be alone,    
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.  
Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.  
For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.  
And stand together yet not too near together:  
For the pillars of the temple stand apart  
And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.[^8-3]  

A continuous cycle of tension and accommodation characterizes the inner life of the family. In the dialectics of
courtship conflicts are the rule rather than an exception.
After marriage, the home furnishes an arena for the
contest of wills. Those who marry are seldom blind
to the probabilities of differences and disputes between
themselves. The prospect of future tension between them
has tremendous reality to them. They speculate upon
the way that they will settle future quarrels. But the
doctrinaire solution: that one is to rule and the other
to obey, is really no solution at all. If indeed the bride
and groom have been educated to believe that one of
them must be master and the other slave, the subordinate
\[p.87\] partner simply works out a technique of cajolery and
persuasion which is more subtle but no less effective
than an outright and independent willfulness.

The laws of domestic tension are not the laws of political dominion. The two differ in method and principle.
In family life it is often the weakest who has his way,
and this by reason of the weakness itself. The willful
child or the childish adult, the bedridden invalid or the
nervous housewife often becomes the tyrant before whom
the stronger willed and better balanced members of the
family habitually give way.

A contest of wills in domestic life is often a competition in irritability. For the family cannot, like the State,
run roughshod over the personality of its members. At
least the family cannot do so with impunity. The object
of the State, as Machiavelli profoundly observed, is to
perdure without limit of time. No one human life, be
it even the life of the Prince, measures the life ambition
of the State. But the natural family has its life-term
meted out to it by the lives of its primary members. The
State can sacrifice the individual and still attain its object; the family can offer up no such sacrifices. The
family must therefore adjust itself to personal frailties
which the State would disdain to take account of.
Chronic resentments and repeatedly injured feelings can
poison family life and continue to poison it as long as
the family lasts. There is no getting rid of the poison
except by making personal adjustments -- or extinguishing
the family. Making a "personal adjustment," after all
(however smooth and inoffensive the words may sound),
is nothing more or less than doing what some one else
wants you to do. 

\[p.88\] It has been established that personal interaction is a
necessary characteristic of the natural family, and that
this interaction is in some degree independent of social
convention. It now appears, when the structure of the
family is examined from the point of view of authority,
that this interaction has the character of a tension between two independent wills. The tension of domestic
life is continuous, but not necessarily unpleasant. It
involves conflict, but not necessarily hostility. It may
take the form of competitive benevolence. The seeming
paradox that there should be conflict without hostility is
explained by the peculiar status of self-interest in family
life. For loving and cherishing in family life are more
significant than obeying.
