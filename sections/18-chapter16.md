THE marriage customs of the Western World attribute an enormous importance to the sex-monopoly
aspect of marriage. Virginity is protected before marriage; adultery is prohibited afterward. Save for those
who have remarried, no one can with propriety acknowledge having had sex intercourse with more than one person in the entire course of his life. Dr. Hamilton found
only forty-one out of a hundred men, only fifty-three
out of a hundred women, who had never violated this
rule.

This ideal of sex monopoly, though historically
traceable to an attitude of contempt for the world,
the flesh, and the devil, has outlived the disintegration of the general otherworldly point of view of the
Church, and presents itself to-day as a special ethic
of sex, quite separated from any general ethic of
asceticism.

Most of our positive teaching on sex has, until recently,
focussed about the sex-monopoly ideal. The pressure of
early education taught to youth one lesson only regarding
sex: that it was a forbidden thing. For the benefit of
adults the community maintained a perpetual campaign
against adultery and fornication. The aesthetics of sex
was neglected and even the bare physiology of sex was
comparatively unknown. Only so much thinking and \[p.189\] talking about sex was permitted as seemed necessary to
protect virginity and prevent adultery.

A consequence of this social pressure has been such a
linking of marriage and sex monopoly that the two are
regarded as inseparable. The conventional courtship involves a promise "to be true," *i.e.,* to refrain from intercourse with another. If either party to a marriage has
had previous sex experience, the fact is one to be concealed or forgiven. If there is an infringement of the
monopoly after marriage, divorce is thought to be the
appropriate remedy.

This identification of marriage with sex monopoly explains the fact that the so-called "revolt" against marriage in Western lands is pretty much a mere attack upon
the sex-monopoly ideal. The belief that marriage is
"bankrupt"[^16-1] which finds expression in contemporary literature usually focusses on the contention that sex monopoly
is indefensible or unattainable. It follows from the nature
of these criticisms that any adequate theory of marriage
must expound in some self-consistent fashion the relation
of marriage to sex monopoly.

In former times it sufficed to denounce as libertines any
who sought to defy the commands of the community in
sex life. To-day such denunciations are inadequate.
People are changing their attitudes. Dr. Hamilton's research uncovered the fact that of his one hundred men
subjects, only fifteen, and of his hundred women subjects
only thirty-two, thought adultery difficult or impossible
to justify. He classified the attitudes of these two hundred spouses toward adultery as follows:

[^16-1]: V. F. Calverton, *The Bankruptcy of Marriage* (Macaulay, New
	York, 1928).  

> \[p.190\] Conservative view: 47 spouses or 24 per cent  
Liberal view: 124 spouses or 62 per cent  
Radical view: 29 spouses or 14 per cent  

An increasing number of people hold that the business
in hand is not to determine whether the commands of the
community have been complied with, but to find out
whether the community ought to give such commands.

Broadly stated, the question is what values are gained
or lost by reserving sex intercourse as an exclusive secret
connived in by two persons alone throughout life. In
these days which have witnessed the falling away of the
ideal of asceticism in general, the rationale of the sex-monopoly ideal of marriage has come to rest chiefly upon
three considerations: an aesthetic appeal, a jealousy danger, and a parenthood risk.

First, of aesthetic appeal: It must be recognized that
coitus when artistically consummated is a supreme and
unique instance of benevolent interaction. The essence
of the domestic values finds expression therein. There is
reciprocity of tenderness and appreciation; there is isolation and personal intimacy. Everything that protects and
develops these potentialities of the sexual act is valuable
to marriage.

The value of coitus as benevolent interaction is increased to the extent that the act is guarded as a unique
and personal possession which the husband and wife
share with each other, but not with the world. Dr.
Hamilton found that only 29 per cent of the men who
committed adultery, and 17 per cent of the women, regarded their marriage as happy. The very characteristics of the sex act which render it so supremely significant
as an expression of the paramount-loyalty attitude of \[p.191\] husband and wife render it dangerous to that loyalty when
it is consummated under conditions of adultery.

closely related to these considerations is one of the
arguments for chastity before marriage: It is urged that
the exploration of the aesthetic possibilities of sex is an excellent coeducational experience to be reserved for the
threshold of domestic life.

Sex monopoly, because of this aesthetic appeal, makes
a positive contribution to the excellence of domestic life.
Conversely, sex liberty, by introducing a rivalry risk, has
a negative influence upon the level of domestic behavior.
There is always a chance that a liaison with a third party
may draw the loyalty of the husband or wife away from
the family. Sometimes the withdrawing of loyalty is
permanent, sometimes only transitory. And even if paramount loyalty is not for a moment withdrawn, and no
significant transfer of affection takes place, it remains
probable that the most transitory outside liaison may
withdraw from the marriage partner some of the warmth
of response that would otherwise be his, and therefore
establish competition in a domain which, in the best interests of the natural family (because of the unique potentialities of coitus as benevolent interaction), should be
beyond the reach of competition.

In addition to rivalry risk a parenthood risk is involved
because promiscuous liaisons on the part of the wife
leave the husband uncertain whether the offspring is biologically his own, and the uncertainty may ruin the role
that children play in the family life. The husband's
promiscuity may confront the wife with a call to make
sacrifices for some illegitimate child toward which she
has no personal attachment whatsoever. Where the sex \[p.192\] connection is intended to be transitory, that is to say,
where no real marriage takes place, the parenthood risk
is especially serious because of the difficulty of providing
for the child. The development of contraceptive technique has diminished but not eliminated the parenthood
risk in sex liberty.

Before casting up the account and reckoning in terms
of domestic values the costs and credits of sex liberty, it
must be noted that there are at least four distinct ways
in which the sex-monopoly ideal can be violated, and
that each type of violation has consequences peculiar
to itself. Two of these types of sex liberty involve a
simultaneous plurality of wives or mistresses, husbands
or lovers, and the other two of them a consecutive
plurality.

One who is having more than a single sex-love affair
going on at the same time may be either adulterous or
polygamous -- or neither. Whether his situation is to be
described by one or another of these terms depends primarily upon whether the relationships are permanent or
transitory. If a sex relationship is permanent, if its duration aspect is dominant, then it follows from the fundamental definitions of the principles of marriage that the
union must be regarded as a marriage, and the persons as
members of a natural family. The marriage license is, of
course, not the decisive thing. If a person who is continuing in such an enduring relationship should indulge
in a transitory affair, his action must be regarded as
adultery. But if the relationship with the additional man
or woman is in like degree permanent and enduring, the
situation cannot be defined as adultery, but must he called
polygamy. The laws and conventions laid down by the \[p.193\] environing society seem powerless to prevent true polygamy, however they may avoid giving legal recognition
thereto. A man who maintains wife and mistress together on his great country estate, and another who rents
one expensive apartment for his lawful mate and another
equally expensive one for his equally permanent mistress,
are both just as much the heads of polygamous families
as is any Moslem sheik or Indian nabob. The distinction
made between the transitory liaison and the permanent
attachment is here the fundamental one.

If neither attachment has a permanence aspect, the
principles of marriage are not directly engaged.

Somewhat more readily tolerated in Occidental civilization is a plurality of liaisons which follow each other consecutively, provided each liaison is registered in a wedding, and its termination told off by means of a divorce.
Since the legal and institutional aspect of marriage does
not give the measure of its more universal significance,
the violation of sex monopoly involved in a series of matrimonial adventures is not fundamentally different from
the violation involved in a series of unions without legal
marriage. The principal difference between absolutely
unrestricted free love and easy divorce at the wish of
either party is simply that in the latter case the man and
wife take the community more fully into the secret of
their intentions. Thus we can regard all instances of a
union which lasts for a time only and is then supplanted
by another union as belonging to a distinct class of violations at the sex-monopoly ideal, for which we suggest the
name "love-tenure marriage"

For these marriages which are designed to end in
divorce-at-will, or these free-love unions, are usually \[p.194\] based upon a philosophy of love which implies that love
can unaccountably depart from a human relationship,
leaving the two ex-lovers no course but to part company.
The permanence of marriage is thus sacrificed in order
that marriage and love may always coincide. Quite different in spirit and in practice is the revision of our code
of sex morals which aims to permit experimental sex relations until permanent marriage takes place. The new
code asserts that virginity need not be maintained until
a permanent mate is found. This ideal of conduct used
to be tolerated as a standard for men only. "A young
man must sow his wild oats," was the saying. The
novelty of to-day is to see the standard proposed as one
to be equally applicable to men and women. Dr. Hamilton found that only forty-six out of the hundred men and
sixty-five out of the hundred women of his research were
virgins at marriage.

Here again we must beware of the danger of confusing
the vital elements of a marriage relationship with its
merely institutional forms. Given the situation as it
stands in Occidental lands, the community is most interested in demanding that some kind of a wedding ceremony
should mark any sex experiment, and, in fact, that the
wedding should intervene before coitus takes place.
From the standpoint of the more general principles of
marriage decisive importance does not attach to the fixing
of the exact point in the development of an experimental
relationship where the wedding ceremony should occur, or
even in the question of whether or not there is any wedding ceremony at all. The important distinction is not
the one that the neighbors make between coitus in wedlock and out of it, but rather the one that inheres in the \[p.195\] mind of the participant: the distinction between experimentation on the one hand and the establishing of something permanent on the other. Thus the distinction
between sex experiment cloaked by wedding and experimentation not so covered can be disregarded.

Sex-experiment and love-tenure marriages, while alike
in that they permit a sequence of sex partnerships, are still
to be distinguished from the Don Juan pattern of sex life,
which lays itself out as an infinite series of equally transitory episodes of conquest. This is the way of life of the
true harlot or the perfect libertine: it is not without its
beauty -- as witnesses the story of Gengi -- but it is not
marriage. It is a perpetual quest for the new experience -- perhaps a quest for perfection. It is inevitably impermanent. Marriage does not enter at all into such lives,
even though (as in Molière's *Don Juan*) a wedding
marks every conquest. From the standpoint of the principles of marriage, this basis of sex life is hardly to be
taken into account, except in so far as the Don Juans
interfere with the marriage destinies of others.

In the flow of change that carries every life in its current, it can happen that any one of these types of sex
liberty can merge into another, or can become monopolistic in fact. The transitory liaison or the experimental
affair can become permanent. The love-tenure marriage
can turn out to be a life-tenure marriage; adultery can
become polygamy, and the polygamous family, by the
lapsing of all but one connection, can revert to a
monogamous basis.

Taking into account the possibility of such transitions
as these, the different types of sex liberty, simultaneous
and consecutive, permanent and transitory, experimental \[p.196\] and love-tenure, must make each its own bargain with the
sex-monopoly ideal.

To begin with, there are certain costs regularly to be
assessed against the notion that sex monopoly is a
supreme end of married life. So far as we can tell, human
experience has pretty well demonstrated that absolute
sex monopoly enforced upon both partners in monogamous marriage is an ideal rather than a practice. Dr.
Hamilton's findings, that twenty-eight out of the hundred
men and twenty-four of the hundred women had committed adultery, are significant in this connection. Sex
liberty of one kind or another is certainly common
enough to be regarded as a normal rather than an abnormal element in modern life. Conditions vary, of
course, in different places and in different social classes.
With regard to this situation, a general theory of marriage
must answer the question whether it is preferable to
modify the ideal in conformity with the practice or to
continue the seemingly vain attempt to bring the practice
into line with the ideal.

The case against the sex-monopoly ideal is not so much
its relative inaccessibility as the gratuitous difficulties it
introduces into married life. The mere fact that an ideal
is not attained would not constitute a reason for abandoning or compromising it: perhaps it is necessary that
ideals should lie beyond the scope of practice; otherwise
they would be mere descriptive categories and not ideals
at all. But we can demand of an ideal that it lead us
toward the most important and significant things, not
diverting our attention to superficialities and trifles. We
can also require of it that it become not a trap for us,
whereby we bring on our own ruin. 

\[p.197\] The baneful effect of the sex-monopoly ideal appears
in two forms: first, in the form of certain measures taken
to enforce monopoly, and second, in the form of certain
penalties exacted when monopoly is violated. The costs
of the enforcement measures must be borne whether or
not there is in fact a breach of monopoly.

The enforcement measure most effectively used to prevent the "simultaneous" type of sex liberty is a strict
taboo which exaggerates and intensifies the rivalry risk
already present in adultery and polygamy. Jealousy, a
by-product of love, furnishes a driving force which impels
each marriage partner to resent sex loyalty. Taboo,
the socially established prohibition, fixes upon adultery
or polygamy as a specifically objectionable act and defines every adulterous act as a tort against the lawful
wife or husband. The combination of these, individual
jealousy plus social taboo, causes each individual to tie
up his own self-respect with the sex fidelity of his spouse.
This third element is illustrated in the jokes about
cuckolds which provide so much of the comic relief in
sixteenth century literature, in the notion that a wife's
faithlessness deprives the husband of his "honor," and in
the so-called "unwritten law" which even in modern times
makes it difficult to convict a "wronged" husband if he
murders his wife's lover.

The taboo on adultery, together with the social convention whereby punishment for violation of the taboo is
visited not only upon the violator but upon the spouse as
well, serves to intensify the jealousy attitude. Jealousy
is indeed an irreducible fact in personal relationships. It
appears as a consequence of competition for the loyalty
of a personal object of affection. It expresses the dis\[p.198\]satisfaction of the self when the personal relationship to
the other is not closed and complete. It is aroused by a
child in the family, by relatives, by friends. But when
the competitor is a child, relative. or guest, jealousy masks
or transforms itself in deference to social convention.
Only when the competitor is a rival lover does convention permit the complete unmasking of the feeling of
jealousy. If conventions required as much self-discipline
in one's attitude as rival for the affection of a spouse as
one must maintain in tennis, politics, or business, marriages would be better able to survive episodes of adultery
or suspicion of adultery.

The sex-monopoly ideal operates, therefore, in a vicious
circle. The social taboo stimulates jealousy and resentment; jealousy and resentment, thus stimulated, render
adultery destructive of marriage. The prospect that
adultery will mean divorce, and the total destruction of a
family, generates new fears which further sharpen
jealousy and resentment. The feeling of insecurity
makes it more difficult to endure humiliation and loss
of face.

To the extent that the marriage partners accept this
system of convention and taboo, they accept also the consequence that every violation of the sex-monopoly code
is a violation of the engagement of paramount loyalty. It
is a symbol of disloyalty, a token that some other interest
than that of husband or wife has been preferred.

The destructive effect of this emphasis on exclusive
sex possession cannot be avoided by merely refraining
from adulterous connections, for the fears which are engendered extend to nonsexual attachments which husband
or wife may have. Pleasant and profitable friendships \[p.199\] may have to be limited or sacrificed in deference to the
duty of forestalling all suspicion, and such restrictions,
however rigorously they be adhered to, may have a galling effect upon the spirit. Often the most ridiculous
jealousies are implemented and fostered by the sex-monopoly ideal. A jealousy will fly back to the years
before marriage -- even to the years before acquaintance -- and concern itself with the early chastity of the present
spouse. Here a wife flies into a passion if her husband
chats for a moment with a female clerk, and there a
husband tries to keep his wife secluded in his apartment
as if it were a harem. And again there are unfounded
and undefined forebodings of disloyalties that may occur
in the future. Fantasy conjures up a corespondent to
answer for a spouse's imaginary misconduct in a hypothetical court of law. All this focussing of thought upon
the enforcement of a right is contrary to the spirit of
marriage.

The measures used to enforce virginity till marriage
are equally costly, and like the anti-adultery measures,
they penalize alike those who obey and those who offend.
If mating is postponed till long after puberty, one of two
methods must be pursued in order to forestall sex experience. The surveillance method, as it is used in
protecting the virginity of women in Mediterranean
countries, is not only costly in time and effort, but also
involves a sacrifice of the moral responsibility of the person supervised. On the other hand, this method dispenses
with the need for building up inhibitions which will later
interfere with the enjoyment of sex. The alternative
method, used especially in countries in which the Teutonic
stock has been drilled in the Puritan tradition, is the \[p.200\] method of moral restraint. Certain negative attitudes
toward sex are so strongly instilled into the youth that
they are inspired to protect their own chastity. The
effect of these attitudes is often injurious, as psychiatry
attests. The Hamilton research revealed that forty-six
out of one hundred married women had unsatisfactory
sex lives in the sense that they experienced no orgasm in
coitus. Of these, twenty had been diagnosed at one time
or another as seriously psychoneurotic. Only one of the
fifty-four women whose sex lives were adequate had ever
been regarded as psychoneurotic. Attitudes which are
useful in preserving virginity are deleterious in marriage.

The mischievous effects of these virginity-protecting
inhibitions are especially marked in the case of the girl.
They mislead her thinking upon marriage, either by inculcating the notion that carnal things are vile or by
overemphasizing the supernatural interpretation of the
nuptial night, which magically transforms a sinful horror
into a lawful delight. In the first instance the development of a healthy aesthetics of sex is handicapped; in the
second instance the fantasies of the schoolgirl theory of
marriage are encouraged.

The harmful effect of the virginity standard upon the
man is likely to appear in the form of a dissociation of
feelings of tenderness and respect from feelings of sexual
enjoyment, so that he becomes unable to cherish any
woman whom he enjoys. As a result of masturbation
fantasies on the one hand, and of "the association, in
thought or deed or both, of sexual practices with prostitutes" a "moral degradation of the sexual object" takes
place.  

> \[p.201\] . . . when later in marriage the young man endeavors to
unite esteem and tenderness with sexual passion, he may find
that the dissociation between these elements of love has grown
too wide and fundamental to be overcome, so that one or other
of these requisites of a complete and happy married life has
necessarily to be sacrificed. As a result of this a man may
marry a woman whom he is prepared indeed to cherish, honor
and esteem, but toward whom (for this very reason) he feels
himself but little attracted in a purely sexual sense; in which
case he will often be tempted after a while to seek a more complete degree of sexual satisfaction elsewhere. Or else, should
the directly sexual trends prevail, he may select a partner who
is inferior to him in some important intellectual, moral or social
respect, thus paving the way for a married life in which many
of his more sublimated tendencies, desires and aspirations are
doomed to suffer permanent lack of gratification.[^16-2]

[^16-2]: J. C. Fluegel, *The Psycho-analytic Study of the Family* (The
	International Psycho-analytic Press, London - New York, 1921), p. 110.
	Freud's hypothesis that this dissociation is a direct result of infantile
	incestuous desires and jealousies seems to the writer far-fetched. The
	phenomenon, common enough, would seem to be sufficiently accounted
	for by the strong anti-sexual bias in the training of children -- a bias
	which is motivated by the desire to keep the children chaste till marriage. 

The enforcement of the monopoly ideal with respect to
attempts at love-tenure marriages is accomplished largely
by strict divorce laws and penalties imposed for desertion. Desertion and divorce are the equivalent means by
which those unions are terminated wherein love has
lapsed. Spectacular instances of unhappiness in marriage,
life tragedies in which the bond of marriage has become
a spirit-breaking fetter, have been exposed in fiction and
in propaganda. It was here that the attack on sex
monopoly was first opened in modern times, and it is here
that the attack has been most successful. Divorce and
remarriage have achieved a degree of social recognition
\[p.202\] not yet accorded to adultery, polygamy, or unchastity
before marriage.

And after this price is paid for the attitudes that are
expected to enforce sex monopoly, it will often happen
that enforcement is lax and desultory. Truly, "the flesh
is weak"; impulses break through the restraints which it
is intended to impose upon them; the pleasure principle
triumphs over the reality principle and attains a momentary equilibrium at the sacrifice of future content.
Phrase the thing as you will in the language of all the
schools from Aristotle and Augustine to Freud and Watson, and the fact remains that these prohibitions do not
successfully prohibit. Despite the price paid for sex
monopoly, we have still to reckon with sex liberty.

If a fair hearing be given to the offender against the
code, it will sometimes transpire that conformity requires
sacrifice. Even after marriage sex cravings may remain
unfulfilled and thus haunt and disturb the mind. Sometimes this is only a transitory condition, as when separation or illness imposes upon one partner a temporary
period of continence. Sometimes it is permanent, as
when the husband and wife differ greatly in sexual vigor.
Frigidity in women, and in men the dissociation of respect
from enjoyment of sex, may ruin the whole sexual side of
a marriage. How often in human experience a strong sex
attraction toward some siren or charmer seems to impose
itself unsought upon a person whose intention is to conform to the monopolistic standard, but who is compelled
by this event to stage a struggle between desire and will!
Every one feels in some way the conflict between desire
for security on the one hand and the wish for novelty on
the other. How far these strains and tensions are the \[p.203\] necessary lot of mankind, and how far they are the
product of disjointed institutions and environmental accidents, is quite uncertain. Many will be found to assert
that man is by nature polygamous, and monogamous marriage a restraint upon his natural disposition. But this is
pure speculation, which has never been controlled by
scientific investigation. In fact, it is doubtful whether
psychology is at present equipped to explore such a question as this.

The pressure of unfulfilled cravings in the case of the
virgin is increased by an important element of curiosity,
To remain chaste is to remain ignorant. Moreover, the
courtship institutions which place upon the individual the
full responsibility for winning his or her own mate penalize the person who cannot flirt. But flirtation in a land
where youth has freedom of automobile transportation
quickly gets out of hand. The petting party is intended
to play with tumescence but stop short of coitus; actually it often goes beyond its self-drawn barrier. Our
confused institutions set for young people a difficult
course to steer between the Scylla of coldness and the
Charybdis of unchastity.

It then, yielding to these pressures, recourse is had to
sex liberty -- adulterous liaisons to meet transitory
stresses, polygamous relationships to relieve permanent
tensions, experimental relationships to satisfy the young,
and an easy transition from one spouse to another to
break the marriage fetter -- how well or ill can these forms
of sex liberty be reconciled with satisfactory domestic
life?

The effect of adultery upon domestic life depends principally upon the meaning that husband and wife attach to \[p.204\] adulterous acts as symbols of disloyalty. If society has
taught them that adultery is the supreme disloyalty, and
they have constructed no other view for themselves, then
the destructive effect of sex liberty upon their family life
will be great and inevitable. The level of domestic interaction will be automatically lowered as paramount loyalty
vanishes. More than that, it is likely to be taken for
granted that adultery destroys marriage and leaves the
injured party no choice but separation and divorce. This
tragic attitude is due to the interpretation given to adultery, not to the intrinsic qualities of the adulterous act.
The divorce for which "infidelity" furnishes ground is
really due not to misconduct alone but also to a socially
induced sensitiveness. Thus a double disaster follows
from adultery when it is interpreted in the light of the
sex-monopoly ideal. The level of domestic behavior is
lowered and the duration of the marriage is threatened.
The two basic values of marriage are thus sacrificed.

If marriage makes the extreme adjustment to this
pressure towards sex liberty it changes from a monogamous to a polygamous basis. The effect of this change
upon family life is not merely a reflection of social conventions, as these have determined the symbolic meanings of acts. It is also a definite change in the structure
of the family. And this change in structure involves a
tendency toward a lower level of domestic interaction.

The polygamous family, analyzed in terms of domestic
theory, is comparable to a monogamous family which
has come to include adult children. In both cases there
is an induction of additional members into an already
existing family. With the children the induction is gradual; with additional wives or husbands it is more sud\[p.205\]den. The children are only secondary members; the
wives and husbands are primary. In both cases the
larger number of complete personalities engaged in the
domestic relationship renders the system of loyalties more
complex and tends to confusion. But when the additional members are wives and husbands rather than
sons or daughters, there is likely to be more jealousy
and less benevolent interaction developed between them.
For the children have had occasion to develop affection
for each other, whereas the natural rivalries of husbands
and wives are not so screened.

Moreover there is no place in the polygamous system
[or paramount loyalty. Paramount loyalty to one spouse
generates an equivalent counteracting jealousy in the
other. With children it is otherwise. They are not
forced into jealousy by the paramount loyalty of father
and mother to each other, because this inter-parental
loyalty takes the form of benevolence to the child. For
the attitude of husband and wife to their child can reflect the idea of joint possession, of cooperative cherishing. But the attitude toward an additional spouse is not
likely to be colored by such an idea.

Finally, if the presence of adult children in the family
should happen to bring about some baneful confusion
of loyalties, this confusion will tend to dissolve away in
time as the children set up their own families. But the
confusion between rival wives or husbands does not terminate itself; rather it goes on increasing in intensity unless dulled by habit. Therefore benevolent interaction
in the polygamous family tends to sink to a low level.

Some polygamous situations are better described by
comparing them to membership in two distinct families. \[p.206\] A man has one family in Philadelphia and another in
Memphis. His position is comparable to that of a husband or wife who feels too strong a loyalty to the parental household. There is a confusion of loyalties and
hence a lowered level of domestic interaction.

The lowered level of benevolent interaction is the
penalty paid for sacrificing the sex-monopoly ideal. There
is no sacrifice of duration.

When duration as well as domestic interaction is sacrificed, the result is comparable to a love-tenure marriage.
If because of an adulterous episode, or in resentment at
a polygamous situation, a marriage is broken up, the
divorcees will say of their broken home that rivalry
and lapsing of true love had made it impossible to continue together. Retrospectively at least, they will think
that marriage may properly last only so long as love
endures. This notion appears among us not only as a
retrospective rationalization of domestic disaster but also
as a project for a new norm of conduct in marriage.
The wedding vow is to be changed to read, "As long as
ye both shall *love*"; marriage in general is to be placed
on a love-tenure basis. What, in terms of domestic
theory, is the consequence of this type of sex liberty?

Just as polygamy sacrifices benevolent interaction but
retains permanence, so love-tenure marriage purports to
sacrifice permanence in the interest of benevolent interaction. Rather than tolerate a unilateral level of
domestic behavior (with all active affection on one side),
or a nondomestic level of behavior (from which all evidences of affection are absent), it is proposed that the
marriage should be terminated, and whatever habit systems or memories it may have accumulated relinquished. 

\[p.207\] This innovation is the most attractive of all the projected modifications of the marriage ideal, because it
attacks one of the marriage values in the name of the
other. It seems to require of marriage everything or
nothing: either the full romantic system of organization,
or divorce.

The danger underlying this sex-liberty ideal is that it
may misconceive the true nature of domestic interaction
and fall into the trap of using the word love in its word-magic sense. Although those who adhere to this ideal
of sex liberty pretend to enormous sophistication, they
are only a step removed from the most naive schoolgirl
theorist. They conjure up and make use of a conception
of love which is not adequate for the purposes of marriage.
Love is regarded as a feeling which comes upon one,
an event which occurs independently of willful action,
a state which one must passively accept if it appears,
and as passively regret if it departs. Concerning this
kind of love there is no sense in promising anything,
for the will is not operative in its business. One cannot
promise, but only prophesy. One cannot commit oneself
to a future line of conduct, but only testify to a present
condition. A conception of love from which the element
of will-commitment is so conspicuously absent is a useless anomaly in marriage.

The weakness of the love-tenure marriage ideal is
therefore not alone that it requires a sacrifice of permanence, but also that it may imply a misconception of the
nature of domestic interaction, so that permanence is
sacrificed not to a true marriage value, but to a phantom
value which belongs rather to courtships and love affairs.

"Companionate marriage" has become a catchword, \[p.208\] spoiled by too much misuse. When M. M. Knight coined
the expression, it meant a marriage which was intended
to be childless, at least for a time. When Judge Lindsay
took it up, he added two more points to the program:
more adequate instruction on sex aesthetics and birth
control, and more lenient divorce laws for childless
couples, allowing separation by mutual consent without
alimony. At the present time the words are coming to
betoken almost any independence of conventional standards in marriage, and a general change in emphasis: less
emphasis on duration, more on love; less on duty to
society, more on personal satisfaction. The observations
which apply to the ideal of love-tenure marriage apply
with equal force to much of the tangle of thinking which
makes use of the term "companionate marriage."" Characteristic of this type of thinking is the subtle transition
from the most naive concept of love to the most sophisticated concept of convention. Equally characteristic is
a tendency to discount duration value in marriage.

The experimental type of sex liberty does not directly
affect either of the marriage values, for if it takes place
at all, it is over before marriage begins. It must be
judged, therefore, by its effect in qualifying or disqualifying persons for successful marriage, and not by its direct
bearing on the success of the family.

Just as in the case of adultery, so also as regards virginity, the taboo which actually exists in Occidental society must be reckoned with, for it penalizes the marriages of those who have had premarital sex experience
by causing the person who does not bring virginity to
the marriage bed to be regarded as damaged goods. The
symbolic significance which conventions assign to vir\[p.209\]ginity must be taken into account by the present generation of young people as a part of the environment to
which they must adjust themselves. But they will wish
to cast up for themselves the advantages and disadvantages of premarital chastity regardless of the ruling of
convention. For they regard themselves as critics rather
than servants of the customs that environ them.

The principal risks which attend experimental sex experience before marriage are the well-known risks of
parenthood and disease. The rivalry risk does not enter
at all. And as regards the aesthetic considerations, it is
debatable whether there is more to be gained by attaining
a thorough first-hand knowledge of sex before marriage
so that marital sex relations can be well carried on from
the beginning, or by foregoing initiation into sex until
it can be enjoyed as part of a total marriage experience,

The parenthood risk is unevenly distributed between
the man and the woman. This is one of the reasons for
the double standard of premarital morality against which
women in recent years have so successfully campaigned.
The unmarried mother who has kept her child has lost
some of her qualifications for wifehood, and the one
who has given up her child may have suffered a shock
which will affect her success as a mother after marriage.
The unmarried father is in a similar dilemma. The
more he feels his responsibility for his illegitimate offspring, the more confused his loyalty will be at the very
time when his bride will expect it to be most direct and
undivided. The more completely he renounces his responsibility as a parent, the more clearly he reveals \[p.210\] success. An illegitimate child before marriage is a handicap in the attaining of marital success.

Those cases in which the parents marry after the birth
of an illegitimate child are of course not different, from
the standpoint of domestic theory, from any other permanent sex union which is for a time unlicensed by society.
In these cases the natural family is fully established before it receives its legal recognition.

The popularization of contraceptives has diminished
the parenthood risk, even though available devices are
not one hundred per cent certain, and the marketing of
them is carried on among young people on a bootleg
basis. The complete elimination of the parenthood risk
must await the better development of contraceptive technique, and the acceptance of a new standard of medical
law (already foreshadowed in German legislation) which
will permit a woman to have a legal right to decide
whether she will bear a child or not.

What is true of the parenthood risk is equally true of
the disease risk. And here also adequate precautions
can offer some protection, but protection is not complete.

The value of first-hand knowledge of sex to one who
undertakes marriage is twofold. In the first place it
can prevent some bungling and disappointment. Hamilton found that the nonvirgin husbands were more likely
than the virgins to be sexually satisfactory to their
wives. Not always. A man's experience with a prostitute may teach him to enjoy voluptuousness but does not
necessarily teach him to make sex enjoyable to a wife.
And if amateurish mistakes are to result in permanent
sexual anaesthesia, it is not clear that such mistakes are \[p.211\] less likely to occur in a premarital experiment than in
a nuptial initiation.

However, if initiation is to be postponed till marriage,
it is necessary that adequate instruction be available to
young people. Otherwise the marriages of virgins are
penalized. Books such as those by Cooper or Stopes
should be available on the open market. If there is to be
chastity till marriage, both partners should realize that
they must study and understand the sex act in order fully
to enjoy it.

There is danger that too much emphasis upon the need
for marriage before coitus may confuse the thought of
young people upon the character of marriage, and hence
unfit them to carry on successful family life. Here
are two very different things: to satisfy sex curiosity,
and to commit one's will to a paramount loyalty through
life. If these two things are so closely linked that the
one is not to be had without the other, many will marry
without having either the intention or the equipment
to make their marriage a success. When sex experiment
is cloaked by a wedding there results a kind of mock-
marriage which, to paraphrase Groves, is no more than
a legalized temporary sex attraction, which, unable to
progress into marriage comradeship, ends in anticlimax.[^16-3]

	1928), p. 106. 

In terms of domestic theory, a revision of standards
of virginity is most dangerous to domestic values if the
marriage license is used to authorize initiation into
sex, when the marriage itself does not constitute a longterm life plan for the bride and bridegroom. If sex
gratification is sought before there is an engagement in
\[p.212\] permanent marriage, the virginity ideal is really surrendered, even though the divorce and remarriage device
may conceal the surrender. Since duration is one of the
two fundamental values of family life, it is important
that the distinction between permanent marriages and
transitory love affairs be not obscured. Rather than confuse all thinking on marriage and family life by forgetting this duration value, it is preferable (from the standpoint of domestic theory) that a margin should be left
for unregistered and unlicensed play of sex.

It cannot escape the attention of the thoughtful reader
of these pages that no intrinsic excellence appears to
attach to sex liberty *per se*. Nor is sex monopoly intrinsically evil.

Where baneful effects are associated with sex monopoly,
these are the result of enforcement measures, taboos,
educational devices. Not sex monopoly but the means
which are used to insure sex monopoly have brought
criticism upon the monopolistic ideal.

The evidence of ethnology attests that the taboos, the
stimulated jealousies, the restrictive laws, the life-warping
inhibitions which are set up among us to discipline sex
life are not to be regarded as the necessary products of
universally prevalent human attitudes. Societies differ
between extreme poles as to the significance they attach
to infringements of sex monopoly, and as to the value
they attach to virginity. According to the customs of
many peoples, virginity is a blemish in bride or groom,
and no one is expected to marry without having had
previous sex intercourse.[^16-4] Adultery is not everywhere
regarded as a serious offense against the family. Malin\[p.213\]owski found that among the Trobriand Islanders adultery
was not considered important, but certain obscene words,
if used by a husband to his wife, were taken as symbols
of supreme disloyalty. In one instance the use of these
words resulted in a suicide. That men can share their
wives without feeling injured thereby is evidenced wherever the institution of hospitality prostitution exists.
That women can share their husbands without jealousy
is illustrated by the case of the Kikuyu wife who reproached her mate: "Why do I have to do all the work;
why do you not buy another wife?" Of course where
the institution of polygamy prevails it is definitely evil
and anti-social for one wife to monopolize the husband.

[^16-4]: Robert Briffault in *The Mothers* collects many instances of this. 

It is Occidental society, then, and not human nature,
which insists on monopoly and virginity and leaves no
freedom for choice. Somehow we must continue to live
at peace with this colossal community. At what price
can we break away from its sex standards?

Can individuals, either alone or in their small Bohemian
communities, defy social rules in these matters? Can
they re-define for themselves the meanings of sex acts
so that they gain freedom from the enforcement measures which society imposes?

The attempt is being made. There are people who
say that so far as they are concerned, virginity does
not matter, and there are others who declare that they
do not demand a monopoly of husband or wife, nor expect themselves to be monopolized. Recent literature
on the family abounds in the records of deliberate and
mutually permitted violations of the sex-monopoly code.
Judge Lindsay knew a young couple who were about
to separate in the conventional way after the husband's \[p.214\] one adulterous connection. But instead of divorce, they
decided to surrender mutually their monopolistic claims
upon each other. And after that they got along famously.
Hamilton records a number of these adultery-toleration
compacts. His evidence suggests that the men in the
case tolerate their wives' adulteries very well, but the
women find it more difficult to suppress feelings of jealousy.

Another case is that of a young man, a punctiliously
honest person, intelligent and well educated, who casually announced one evening some time in the fourth year
of his marriage that he was by nature polygamous and
would not consider himself bound to refrain from intercourse With other women. He had no objection to any
similar course his wife might take with other men. He
proposed that neither of them should interpret such
conduct as disloyal. And after he had made this declaration, nothing whatsoever was done about it. He had at
the time no particular woman in mind, and he has had
no love affair since. Following this declaration there
ensued the same orderly married existence that had preceded it. The gesture was an act of liberation whereby
the husband sought to re-define the meaning of sex loyalty in his family life.

These attempts to avoid the use of social conventions
in dealing with sex problems require for their success
a certain careful conspiracy against publicity. If those
who attempt them cannot maintain their privacy, they
will find it difficult to escape from the pressure of the
judgment of their neighbors.

But if they are successful in mapping their own course,
in what direction are they to go? None of the four \[p.215\] types of sex liberty has any intrinsic superiority to the
monopolistic state. Neither promiscuity nor divorce is
an end worth seeking for itself.

Though divorce may, under certain circumstances, be
a lesser of two evils, it cannot be other than an evil
in marriage. It is both a symptom and a disease. In
terms of hedonism and individualistic ethics, divorce is
a symptom. It indicates that the marriage has not been
pleasing and has not proved worth while to the individual.
In terms of domestic theory, divorce is an absolute evil
in that it destroys duration value, and duration value
is one of the two essential marriage values. So also
with adultery and polygamy. They may indeed relieve
some strain, but their tendency is necessarily to degrade
the level of domestic interaction in the family, even if
the tendency does not decisively determine the event.
Sex liberty does not pretend to contribute anything of
positive value to the natural family. Sex monopoly,
rather, is the norm of family life.

But at the some time it is dangerous to permit this
norm to assume the status of a mandate by the community.

Exclusiveness in sex is an ideal toward which natural
marriage may spontaneously and rightly strive, but it is
not properly a standard to be imposed upon married
people, willy-nilly, from without.

The disastrous results of the sex-monopoly ideal occur
when the ideal is attached to the family as an institution;
they do not occur when tho ideal is attached to the natural
family.

Is it not reasonable that people should be left free
to decide for themselves to what extent they will regard \[p.216\] extra-marital sex relations as disloyal? If, taking circumstances into account, they decide to maintain sex
life as an exclusive secret between them, this decision
could then be an expression of the implicit artistic principles of family life rather than a mere surrender to external pressure.

When circumstances, either temporary or permanent,
bring it about that the maintenance of sex monopoly
imposes a real sacrifice upon one or the other partner,
husband and wife might well be free to agree whether
the sacrifice imposed does not outweigh the advantage
to be derived from monopoly.

And the mere act of adultery need not be construed
as final evidence of a definitive lapse of paramount loyalty toward husband or wife. Such constructions are
arbitrary fictions which derive their appearance of validity from social judgments rather than from the actual
experience.

These principles clear up a seeming inconsistency which
pervades much of the liberal writing on marriage. Again
and again propagandists of marriage reform have argued
against the strictness of the marriage fetter, only to conclude that if marriages were more free they would come
in the end to observe more completely monopolistic standards of behavior. Thus they seem at once to affirm the
value of the sex-monopoly ideal and to deny it. The
truth is that the ideal is good as a plan of life, but bad
as an enforced element of the marriage institution.

Is it possible to avoid the strain which the sex-monopoly ideal places upon marriage, without giving up the
advantages which this ideal confers? If such an end
is to be attained, it is necessary, first of all, to limit the \[p.217\] emphasis on sexuality in family life. This is harsh doctrine in the ears of the younger generation who have
carried the reaction against Puritanism so far that they
seem now to foster sexuality even at the expense of
family life, and to regard marriage as if its whole meaning were exhausted in the one item, sex. The mixture
of fad and sanity that characterizes any extreme reaction
is present in this revolution in marriage ideals.

Some of the revolutionary changes seem fated to endure. The movement to develop the aesthetic side of
sex is sound. The dropping away of the extraneous
institutional functions of the family (economic, religious,
political) carries with it as a consequence a relatively
greater emphasis on sex. It would be vain to try to
sweep back the tide, to restore to the family its lost
functions, or conceal the facts of sex again in Puritanical
obscurantism.

Because of these changes, it now remains to give to
the natural family, already stripped bare of its institutional trappings, a clearer consciousness of its meaning
and purpose. These must include sex, but sex must not
have too destructive a primacy. The erotic side of
marriage has decisive importance, but only as a part
of a more general scheme. The concept of domestic
interaction and duration as the primary function of the
family includes sex play, and reaches beyond it. Sex
monopoly is a part only, not the whole, of sex life in
marriage. And sex life in marriage is itself a mere part,
and not a completed whole. If we start with a definite
notion of the functions of the natural family, the true
place of the sex-monopoly ideal in the marriage scheme
can be deduced therefrom. 

\[p.218\] A decision to conform completely to the sex-monopoly
ideal, involving the renunciation of plurality of sex connections whether simultaneous or consecutive, is properly
a decision to be made freely, for aesthetic reasons, in
order to protect or enhance the two basic marriage values:
domestic interaction and duration. This line of conduct
need not be imposed by the community; it should be
the free choice of those who accept the implicit principles of marriage.
