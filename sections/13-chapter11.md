A DOMESTIC act, by definition, involves two persons,
because it performed by one person on behalf of
another. We have hitherto considered only its source or
origin; we are now to consider its effect as well. With
reference to any particular domestic net, we can designate the two family members involved by calling them
respectively the active member and the beneficiary member. The active member is the person performing the
domestic act: the beneficiary member is the person for
whose benefit the act is done.

It lies before us now to inquire whether there is any
mode of domestic behavior which is proper to the beneficiary member. The active member, we have seen, is
known by his domestic motive, his preponderant interest
in the welfare of another person. What response on
the part of the beneficiary member constitutes domestic
behavior?

Certainly the family permits and encourages a reciprocity of domestic activity, so that a beneficiary member
with reference to one act may be the active member with
reference to another. The wife prepares a dessert which
she knows will delight her husband; the husband buys
something which he is sure will please his wife. It would
be possible perhaps to regard the husband's activity as
being in some way a complement to the wife's. But such \[p.124\] an interpretation of the facts would stultify our conception of the principles of marriage. For benevolent
activity would then become a mere matter of exchange.
The principle of *do ut des*, I give that you may give, is
an economic principle, not a principle of domestic relations. An act done in consequence of some benefit to be
received, and with intent to repay an equivalent benefit,
loses its domestic character and becomes economic. In
so far as the attempt is made consciously to maintain a
balance of benevolent activity, so that the quantity rendered by one member shall be equal to the quantity he
receives, that activity is no longer domestic. It is therefore excluded that we should consider that the beneficiary
member responds to domestic activity in his favor by himself entering upon domestic activity. The interplay of
benevolence in a family is not a mere exchange of favors
on a market basis; it is spontaneous.

Domestic behavior in the beneficiary member is passive. It is not an act but an attitude -- the attitude of
appreciation. Appreciation is the complement of domestic activity. It is the passive mode of domestic behavior. If A does something for B, and B appreciates
what A has done, the domestic act is completed.

Far from compromising the domestic quality of an act,
or reducing it to a mere exchange of services, appreciation rather intensifies its domestic quality by bringing
more clearly to the attention that component in the motive which was domestic. If the wife assumes that it is
solely for her sake that the husband has bought two
tickets to the theater, the husband is likely to forget that he bought them partly to please himself. There
is a magic in appreciation by which, as the deriva\[p.125\]tion of the word suggests, it enormously magnifies little
things.

In the interplay of domestic activity and appreciation -- a total behavior to which we give the name "domestic
interaction" -- there is comprehended both the active and
the passive side of love. The attitude of appreciation, in
its most intense form, can amount to a worship of the
beloved. In a more commonplace form it is a simple
recognition of benefits which a loved one confers upon
one.

In the ever significant act of sex, where domestic attitudes come most sharply to focus, there can develop a fine
balancing of the active and passive sides of love. This
act is not fully developed aesthetically, it has not reached
its full beauty, unless each participant has at once the
sense of giving pleasure to the other, and of recognizing
spontaneity in the free gift he receives. These two attitudes are distinct. Sometimes they are separated. Dr.
Hamilton found in his inquiry into the sex lives of a
hundred married women that for thirty-two of them the
sex act was often less than mutual; for eight of them it
was always sheer submission. The frigid woman who
derives no direct pleasure from her husband's embraces
performs a domestic act when she submits to them; her
husband for his part may appreciate her sacrifice, but
he cannot regard his own action as domestic, nor is there
any ground for appreciation by the wife. The act of sex
is appropriately the central fact in the psychological
situation of marriage, for in this act a complete system of
domestic behavior, both active and passive, can be manifested.

The ratio of domestic activity to appreciation is a sig\[p.126\]nificant index of the quality of a domestic life. This
ratio can be observed in the individual members, where
it may be a consequence of the set of one's character or
an indication of the way family life is organized. And it
can be studied in the relationship of the family members
among themselves, where it serves to distinguish the fundamental types of family from each other.

When we first contemplate the fact that an individual's
domestic behavior may consist of an active or a passive
component, we realize that we will have to explore the
consequences of individual differences among men. Some
people will seem predisposed to a passive attitude, and
others will tend to meet each situation with action.

It would contribute greatly to the convenience of students of mankind if individual human beings showed no
variations among themselves, and if all of them behaved
exactly alike when placed in like situations. We feel the
initial inadequacy of any general rule of human behavior,
because none of the people with whom we become acquainted turn out to be average men. We set up this
standard of domestic behavior, and we imagine the uniform benevolence of a domestic man, but we know that
real people differ from this ideal type, and that they
differ in varying degrees and in diverse ways.

The idiosyncrasies which we sum up in the word
"character" resist systematic classification. We say in
an offhand way that this person is stupid and that one
bright, that this one is good and that one bad, that one
is passionate and another frigid and so forth. A more
comprehensive scheme is suggested by the ancient tradition of our culture which distinguishes men as choleric,
sanguine, bilious, or phlegmatic. There have been a \[p.127\] number of attempts to found a science of character in
recent years. Kretschmer's "six fundamental temperaments" and Spranger's "ideally basic types of individuality" are examples. One scheme for classifying psychological types which may turn out to be of real service in
studying domestic behavior is Jung's distinction between
the introvert and extravert. The introvert makes internal adjustments to his situation: the extravert always
tries to "do something about it." The introvert is acutely
conscious of his own feelings; the extravert is less given
to introspection and more inclined to purposive action.
The domestic behavior of an extravert will perhaps tend
to take the form of domestic activity, of cherishing. The
introvert may manifest his domestic behavior more frequently in the form of appreciation. The pale lovers who
sicken and sigh in despair are introverts: the red-blooded
lovers who try to abduct their women are extraverts.
Intraversion and extraversion are of course relative terms.
There is nothing absolute about the classification. The
introvert is still capable of purposive action, the extravert can entertain the feeling and make the gesture of
appreciation.

We took note of the fact that within the meaning of
the word love are included experiences of feeling on the
one hand and of evaluating and purposing on the other.
These two kinds of love experience, when looked upon
from the standpoint of the natural family, are, respectively, appreciation and domestic activity. The introvert
type tends to stress the one, the extravert the other.
Both are necessary to the complete functioning of the
family.
