ONE who is about to invest his life in marriage has
no disposition to look for the consequences which
ensue to the race or the world from marriage in general,
whereof his own is an inconspicuous instance. That his
own marriage, together with billions of others, may perpetuate the race and transmit the social heritage is a fact
of meager importance to him. The Occidental does not
marry in order to fulfill a public duty. In China, according to Keyserling, these general considerations motivate
marriages, but this fact must be interpreted in connection
with the submerging of the natural family in the Chinese
household. Certainly in the Western World any man
who should propose marriage to a girl out of regard for
the interests of society or race could hardly expect to
have his argument taken seriously. Our own day is especially hostile to the idea of making marriage a matter
of duty and obligation; here if anywhere the thing must
be done for its own sake.

Marriage is by no means unique in this disparity between the social or racial functions it fulfills and the
actual motives and purposes of the individuals who engage in it. The same thing is true of business. A stockbroker does not open his offices in order to aid in the
important function of distributing economic goods, nor
does a street car conductor take his job in order to assist \[p.135\] in furnishing transportation to the community. However,
there is this significant difference between the attitudes
of a man in business and of a man and woman in marriage: that the men in business know exactly what they
want, while those who marry are much less clear as to
their purposes. The stockbroker wants "to make money,"
the conductor hopes "to make a living." They have been
taught from childhood the meaning of business and the
purpose of having a job. The bride and groom have received no such instruction; their purposes are more
beautiful, more fanciful and more variable than the purposes of broker and conductor, but they are also less
clear.

Can we not clarify these purposes, separate the possible from the fantastic, and discover that aim in marriage and that object in family life which have real and
direct meaning to young people who are planning their
firm? What must marriage give them if they are to
regard it as a success?

It is fruitless to discuss the function or purpose of the
family without establishing beforehand the point of view
from which the discussion is to proceed. From the point
of vieW of the human species as a whole, or of civilization
in general, it might appear that the family fulfills this or
that function. But from the point of view of the family
these same alleged "functions" might appear vain and
meaningless.

We might imagine ourselves on the top of a high mountain, far removed from the turmoil of actual life, looking
down upon countless little homesteads in the valleys below, and asking, "What end do these serve?" Around us
would stretch the panorama of nature, its trees and its \[p.136\] grasses and flowers, and of these we might also ask, "What
end do they serve?" And we would recognize the
artificiality of our question, for nature has no purposes.
Still we might fix arbitrarily upon some fragment of the
totality of nature, and ask how all the other things
contribute to the persistence of the selected fragment.
There are some cows grazing in a little glen, and with
reference to these cows we can easily discover the function of the grass, the trees and the homesteads. The
grass nourishes the cows, the trees offer them shade, the
homesteads supply them with shelter. Or again we can
direct our minds to the whole human species, and inquire
how all of these things which lie before us contribute to
the persistence of the human race. The grass and the
cows and the trees all have their importance in this connection, and so also have the homesteads, and the families
which inhabit the homesteads. The family, it may be,
contributes to the welfare of the race and society, but this
does not mean that the welfare of the race and society
are intrinsically the ends of the family. It is only the
accidental turn of a query, and not the inevitable nature
of the family itself, which can fix upon racial or social
welfare as "ends" of domestic life.

We have defined the family, not as a social institution,
but as something anterior to and independent of society.
We are studying it, not as an element of social organization, but as a thing in nature. Hence we cannot judge it
as if it existed for the sake of society; we must think of
it as existing for itself. We have noted, furthermore, that
family life has values which cannot be shared outside its
circle. The family stands in isolation, as an autonomous
system. Should we from the mountain top assign trans\[p.137\]cendent ends and purposes to the families, we should be
denying the isolation and autonomy of the family. If
there is an end toward which domestic life strives, this
end must be something immanent within the family, not
transcendent and reaching beyond it.

We leave the mountain top; we cease to inquire about
the race or society; we come down into one of the cottages
of the valley, and see a family sitting around the evening
lamp. Here is an object in nature to be studied, as one
might study a specimen of algae, a mollusk, a colony of
streptococci, or a eucalyptus tree. How can we attribute
an end or aim to this entity which is set before our neutral
gaze? How can we know whether this family is "successful" or not? We would not ordinarily think of ascribing ends and aims to mollusks and streptococci.
These things are what they are, and the only aim we can
possibly attribute to them is the aim of continuing stubbornly to be what they are. The separate organs or parts
of these things have indeed their functions; the valves,
muscles, chlorophyl, cells, sap, neuclei, all have their ends
in the maintenance of the organism. Our concept of
"organism" permits us to ascribe functions to the *parts*,
but to the organism as a *whole*, studied in isolation, we
can assign no functions whatsoever. Analogously, when
we study the family *per se* the only functioning that we
can discover is an interrelated activity of the members,
not a service which the total family renders to something
else. The functioning of the family is not a matter of
what the family does or fails to do for the world, but a
matter of what the family members do or fail to do for
each other. The only end or purpose which we can properly attribute to the family is one which relates on the \[p.138\] one hand to the actions, on the other to the intentions of
the members thereof.

Out of what combination of intention and achievement,
of will and of act, is there compounded this thing which
we seek as "success" in marriage?

&nbsp;  

From the point of view of the individual family member why should one marry at all? What contribution
will marriage make to one's life? What purpose is intrinsic to a marriage project?

To have children? But why have children? From the
standpoint of the race, of course, they are necessary, and
it is the "function" of the family to produce them. But
from the standpoint of those who marry they are simply
prospective members of the very organism which is under
discussion. Why bring this organism into existence?
To say that one marries in order to have children is
psychologically less accurate and logically no more satisfactory than to say that one marries in order to have a
husband or a wife.

There is indeed that important difference between the
status of husband and wife and the status of children:
the former are necessary to the existence of a family,
the latter only contingent. That which is implicit in the
sex side of marriage is not the certainty, but the possibility only, of having children.

The development of a technique of contraception in
the Western World has tended to bring about a separation
of the idea of marriage from the idea of child-breeding.
It is safe to say that if only those couples were allowed
to obtain marriage licenses whose primary object in
marrying was to beget children, the revenues of county \[p.139\] clerks and clergymen would be seriously curtailed. But
the old fact of contingency remains: the device used to
induce fertility, be it a witch-doctor's charm or a gynecologist's diet prescription, is just as subject to uncertainty as the device used to prevent conception. And
whether children are born of the union or not, the family
continues.

It will be necessary to go more deeply than is here possible into the problem of values which confronts those
who try to decide whether they want their marriage to be
childless or fertile. In the meantime one cannot beg the
question by assuming out of hand that the only object of
marriage is to beget offspring. It may be that the logic
of the marriage situation is such that childless marriages
are inevitably failures, and that the procreation of children is a precondition of successful family life. But even a
fertile marriage may be a failure. A search must be made
for some principles of purpose or function which will
encompass the barren marriage along with the fertile, and
which will apply no less to the aged families that have
had children than to the young families which are about
to have them.

It cannot he disputed that the total sex situation, which
includes the possibility of children, has given the family
its fundamental tone and character. But it may he that
the family may have risen above its source, and that out
of a child-breeding function it may have created a system
of values which can exist without children. If this transmutation has taken place it is only another instance of
that general law which Vaihinger once wished to formulate
as "the law of the preponderance of the means over the
end." The qualities of family life which originate as a \[p.140\] means for caring for offspring may have become ends in
themselves.

Were it not for the development of a technique of contraception on the one hand, and the so-called "emancipation of woman" on the other, we might never have had
to face the problem of discovering some broader and
more universal principle of success in family life than the
biological principle. Were it not for the appearance in
civilized life of vast nonbiological value-systems, aesthetic
and ethical, we might not be in a position to appreciate
or understand any other function of family life than the
biological one. But the facts as they stand in the Western
World to-day indicate that the child-breeding function
does not suffice to explain the family in terms of the purposes of its members, nor is the fecundity of a marriage
an adequate test of its success.

In every civilization much of the actual intention of
those who marry reflects the prevailing social code. They
marry in order to secure that which they are taught to
expect in marriage. This influence of social pressure upon
the purposes of family members is evident in the attitude
toward child-breeding. Married people tend to reflect in
their own minds the community's appraisal of the importance of having children. In some communities large
families are much esteemed and childless marriages looked
upon with contempt. In other communities the parents
of a large family are pitied, and the childless couple
viewed without condemnation. Needless to say, a married
pair will be more likely to leave children out of their
calculations if the sentiment of the community approves
of childless marriages.

In this respect as in others, the sentiment of the com\[p.141\]munity is often a product of some real social need.
Among warlike or colonizing peoples fecundity will
usually be highly valued; among peoples who are living
near the limit of their food supply, or among those who
have developed wide luxury tastes, social approval may
be withdrawn from the extremely fecund marriage. This
is the situation in some Polynesian communities and in
American cities. The modern rationalization of this
attitude is a comprehensive doctrine of population growth
which teaches that the result of breeding up to the
biological potentialities of the race would be unmitigated
disaster.

It is not only with respect to child-breeding that the
community tries to define the purposes of family members
and to measure the success of families. Many elements
of family life are subject to community judgment. Where
polygamy is the rule, it may be that the man who has the
greatest number of most valuable wives and concubines
is accounted to have the most satisfactory family, just as
the pair who have the largest brood of children may be
looked upon as most successful in the community which
approves of fecundity

The principle of conformity to conventional standards, 
however, is not a satisfactory principle of success in marriage. It is a principle which relates to the family institution, but not to the natural family. The scope and
limitations, as well as the mechanism, of the community's
influence upon the family members, have been analyzed
in the chapter on Conventions and the Family. It is
clear that the must important increments of family life
go on beyond the reach of the community. 

\[p.142\] Most of the judgments we actually pass upon some one
else's family are a resultant of our own socially-given
standards rather than an attempt to measure an absolute
excellence in family life. If we discover that a traveling
salesman living at Newark, New Jersey, has an extra wife
in Omaha, we jump to the conclusion that his marriages
are both failures, whereas it may be, for all one knows,
that save for the intervention of the law both marriages
are successful. Or again, if a wealthy banker maintains
in the same city a wife and several mistresses, we declare
without further inquiry that his family life is ruined.
But if we lived in another society, we should draw opposite conclusions from the same facts. The Chinese hold
that it is correct to yield to the mother-in-law the
dominant position in the household; Americans regard
such an abdication as lamentable or laughable. Wherever
in our judgments on the success or failure of a marriage
we find ourselves merely judging conformity to our own
institutional rules, our attitude is blind, and leaves us
helpless.

For it happens that at the present time our institutional
rules [or family life are uncertain; our system of social
conventions relative to marriage is changing under the
pressure of criticism; the young people may be willing
enough to conform and to accept conformity as a test of
success, but how are they to choose among the contradictory marriage institutions which demand their conformity?

The ideal of monogamy and of contract marriage rather
than purchase marriage they find well enough established
in their milieu, but aside from this the conventions are in
conflict. What of trial marriage, companionate marriage, \[p.143\] birth control, woman's place? To mention any one of the
leading problems of magazine is to call to mind another
instance where social guidance fails us, and where we
must choose between conflicting rules, certain, however
we may decide, that some people will approve and others
condemn.

Conformity to convention is not a test of domestic
values. The conventions which demand conformity are
themselves among the things requiring to be tested. The
confusion in social guidance which the Western World
offers to those who marry is evidenced both directly and
indirectly. Directly there is a cross fire of propaganda
emanating from different schools and expounding divergent ideals of domestic life. The slogans of free love,
eugenics, feminism, and conservatism are irreconcilable.
The ideal of eugenics, which stresses the biological significances of marriage, contradicts the ideal of free love,
although Ellen Key tried to conceal this contradiction by
pretending that children born of parents who loved each
other inherited a superior endowment in consequence of
the subjective state of the parents at the time of conception. Ellen Key's hypothesis, of course, has no standing
in the science of genetics. The appeal which feminism
makes for a sex solidarity among women is basically more
opposed to the free love ideal than to the conservative
ideal of woman's domestic sphere. The confusion of
ideals is not only a conflict between conservatism and
novelty, but also a conflict between contradictory proposals of innovation.

The indirect source of confusion in social standards of
domestic life lies in the social, economic, and intellectual \[p.144\] that the services once rendered to an individual by his
family are now rendered to him by other agencies. Professor Ogburn lists seven services which the family rendered to our ancestors, namely:

> 1. Economic  
> 2. Religious  
> 3. Protective  
> 4. Educational  
> 5. Recreational  
> 6. Status-defining  
> 7. Affectional  

According to Professor Ogburn, it lies at the root of
modern family disorganization that six out of these seven
functions of the family are lapsing in modern life. People
are coming to look elsewhere than to the family for these
services, and groups other than the family are assuming
these functions. A man's wife was his business partner
in the day of the spinning wheel and in the environment
of the milking shed, but not in the day of the can-opener
and in the environment of the elevator and dumb-waiter.
The religious meaning of the family was greatest when
there were household gods to be worshiped; it was still
great when the Bible was read by the head of the house
while the children sat around the table, in silence; but in
these present days religion is usually paid off, so far as
the family is concerned, when the minister receives the
envelope from the best man, or when the children are sent
to Sunday School. The protective service given by husband to wife has been reduced to the formal gesture of
escorting her home from the theater alter dark, while for
all real protection against danger or violence one turns to \[p.145\] the telephone and the police. The training of children is
committed more and more to a corps of teachers, and
takes place more and more in institutions outside the
home, from nursery school to college. The movies, the
amusement parks, and the public playgrounds replace the
home as a play center. Except for a few thousand
families who preserve the traditions of a past age, social
status is far more a matter of individual achievement than
of family connection. There remains that service or function which Ogburn has called "affectional." Here and
here only the domain of the family has not been invaded.
No other social organ shows any tendency to usurp this
function from the family; on the contrary, business and
education are becoming constantly less personal and giving constantly less scope for the play of affection.

But the social conventions relating to marriage in the
Western World have not yet adapted themselves to the
new situation. People are therefore required to choose
among competing standards, and cannot merely accept a
prevailing standard. Were it not for this practical problem of choice, we might not have felt the need of searching for an absolute standard of excellence in family life,
nor need we have occupied ourselves with the problem of
defining the functions of the natural family.

Upon what universally valid principle can we act in
choosing that system of conventions to which we will
purpose to conform, and by which we will judge the success of a family? If, confronted by this question, we
turn upon ourselves for counsel, a native urge impels us
to grasp at one of the things that seems to us ultimate -- happiness. Let us by all means be happy; let us conform
to the rules of that marriage institution which will make \[p.146\] us glad, and turn aside from those conventions which
sadden us. With happiness as a working standard we
may go a little way, but we cannot go far, for happiness
is not the kind of thing one can measure in a test tube.
There is the happiness of the bacchante and the happiness
of the contented cow. How can these be measured in
and weighed against each other?

The test of happiness is difficult to apply. If marriages
are happiest in which girls are "married young, treated
rough, and told nothing," let us accept this as one of our
marriage conventions, and let us then condemn the failure
of those who marry mature women, treat them gently,
and impart information to them. If the monogamous
marriage is conducive to more gayety of spirit than the
group marriage, let us convert the Polynesians to the
Christian point of view and induce them to give up their
heathenish practices. If, on the other hand, it appears
that the group-marrying Polynesians get more joy out of
the thing than the missionaries, let the missionaries be
converted. If we observe that young people who practice
birth control are gay, while those unacquainted with the
technique are morose and serious, we conclude that the
practice of birth control is a commendable addition to the
line of conduct which society shall demand of married
people. If virginity before marriage results in unhappy
sex life, we will adopt the more hilarious practices of
the numerous primitive peoples who do not permit virgins
to marry, and we will condemn chastity before marriage
as unsocial and unconventional conduct.

We may, if we wish, apply this test of happiness to all
the marriage systems of the world and compare the joy
of being a Borneo bride with the pleasure of being an \[p.147\] Eskimo husband. But our results will be inconclusive
in two ways. First of all, the test of happiness is particularly hostile to the tradition of Christian marriage,
for the Christian marriage has always been a compromise
with sin, and has looked with contempt upon the mere joy
of sex.

And then again, an institution cannot confer happiness.
Happiness is a thing achieved by people individually. Let
these young people accept whichever of the conflicting
standards of conduct they see fit to choose -- the problem
of happiness remains unsolved for them. They still stand
before life without any solid guarantee that happiness will
be their reward for living according to the rules they
have chosen.

&nbsp;  

If we no longer raise the question of conformity to
socially-given rules, and the parallel question of selecting
among contradictory rules, we are still tempted to judge
the success of a married life by the happiness it grants.
We wish to estimate the amount of pleasure enjoyed by
the members of a family, and conclude that if this amount
is large, the family is a success; if it is small, the family
is a failure. We will discard all other classifications.
We will not ask whether there were children, but only
whether husband and wife are happy together. We will
not inquire whether it is polygamous or monogamous, old-fashioned or companionate, but only whether the husband
and wife enjoy themselves.

In connection with the scientific research conducted by
Dr. G. V. Hamilton, a working definition of the happy
marriage was drawn up by rating those persons as happily
wedded who expressed satisfaction with their married \[p.148\] state. This definition proved to be useful in classifying
and evaluating the experiences of the two hundred married persons whose testimony was taken as a basis of the
research. From the retrospective standpoint this, after
all, is the only test of a happy marriage. As a general
ideal the concept is definite enough to be opposed to
Keyserling's theory that marriage is essentially a tragic
situation. But the definition is quite unserviceable in
orienting the purposes of those who are planning to
marry. Certainly the bride and groom intend so to conduct themselves that they will later be satisfied with what
they have done. But what are the desires which marriage
can satisfy? How are we to restrain those who demand
too much of marriage, and thereby foredoom themselves
to disappointment? How are we to educate those who
fail to appreciate at their just worth the things that marriage offers, and thereby remain dissatisfied with their
married life because they are blind to what it does for
them? To propose as a solution to those problems the
judgment that the thing men seek in marriage is happiness and that by happiness is meant the feeling of being
satisfied with the married state, is to mock the whole
quest for guidance by arguing in a circle.

The purely hedonistic standard of domestic achievement is valid enough as a part of a general hedonistic
philosophy of life. If we judge everything under the
sun by estimating its contribution to our pleasure or our
pain, we are justified in weighing marriage in the same
scale. The arguments for and against this general
hedonistic doctrine have been the commonplaces of ethical
theory since the time of the Stoics and Epicureans. It
is unnecessary to discuss them here, for they have no \[p.149\] precise bearing upon marriage as distinguished from
other things in life. If we declare that the successful
family is the happy family in the same sense that the
successful plumber, doctor, lawyer, or admiral is the one
who is happy, we have learned nothing of the special
character of domestic achievement.

Sometimes this hedonistic view of marriage is offered,
not as a part of a general philosophy of pleasure, but as
a special analysis of marriage alone. It is made to appear
that the production of happiness is the special duty of
the family. If any one is seen to be happy, let his family
life receive the credit for his good fortune, and if he is
observed to be sad, let his family take the blame. This
is, of course, an exorbitant demand to make upon marriage. If one of these dour men who rarely smile and
never laugh is married, do we require that his character
must change before he can be credited with success in his
domestic existence? And must we regard all these
merrily irresponsible people as proficient in marriage
simply because of their unfailing good humor? These
constant factors of character operate to make people predominantly joyful or sad, regardless of how well they
are married and irrespective of whether they are married
at all.

Moreover, there are always a number of independently
variable external influences which operate to make people
glad or unhappy. Can we demand of marriage that it
counteract the effects of toothache or bankruptcy? When
affliction comes from an outside source, it may be more
painful to a good husband or wife than to a bad one. A
man may feel a failure more poignantly because he sees
that it affects his family. A personal attachment always \[p.150\] involves the risk that we may have to share sympathetically in pain which would not touch us otherwise. A
family is a hostage given to fortune, which makes us
more sensitive than we would otherwise be to the buffetings of an unkind world. How unfair, therefore, to require of marriage that it guarantee happiness to us. The
hedonistic classification is misleading. Keyserling does
well to warn us that marriage may be an essentially
tragic situation. However desirable a happy marriage
may be, we cannot accept the distinction between happy
and unhappy marriages as the most significant one for
those who wish to see clearly into the nature of marriage,

The purely economic distinction between richer and
poorer families is a crude variant of the hedonistic classification. When people say of a girl that she is happily
married, they often mean nothing more than that she is
married to a man who is supporting her in comfort, and
when they say of a marriage that it did not turn out well,
they often mean simply that the family cannot pay its
grocery bills. Inasmuch as a certain minimum of economic success is always necessary in order to lift human
life above the brute level, there is a material precondition
to the functioning of the family. This fact must be taken
seriously into account by young lovers, however impatient
they may be of material obstacles to their desires. But
once the subsistence level is reached, any further variation in the prosperity of the family has only a superficial
relation to true domestic excellence. Dr. Hamilton, in his
research on marriage, reached the conclusion that dis-
contented wives or husbands who complain of money 
troubles in the home are usually making use of the money
trouble as a peg upon which to hang some resentment \[p.151\] which results from a deeper cause, and that there is no
significant correlation between financial success and marriage satisfaction.

If neither the biological principle nor the principle of
conformity to convention nor the hedonistic principle adequately defines the functioning or measures the success
of the natural family, where is a more adequate criterion
to be found? Such a criterion is actually implicit in the
definition of marriage and family, and needs only to be
deduced from premises already established.

Marriage, it will be recalled, is a sex relationship considered in its aspect of duration. The time element enters
into marriage as an essential part thereof, whereas children are only a contingent consequence. The roughest
and simplest test of a good marriage is actually the
endurance test. The first function of a marriage is to
last. If the purposes of those who marry do not include
the intention that the relationship is to persist through a
period of time, there is actually no marriage at all.

Applying this test roughly to the marriages that we
know, we ask of them: Do they last? If the marriage
ends in a divorce court, we consider it a failure. Whenever other things are equal, the success of a marriage is
directly proportioned to its permanence. A period of
time is necessary in order that the family may gain an
individual character and develop a distinctive organization by the successive laying down of new strata of habit.
The qualities which are legitimately sought in domestic
life are time-given qualities. The ideals and purposes
which are proper to marriage are those which permit of
permanence. True enough, people do not all live at the
same tempo; it is possible that some marriages which last \[p.152\] only a few years may be productive of more positive
domestic achievement than others which last till death.
But aside from differences in the rate of living, the social
convention or individual purpose which limits the duration
of a marriage limits also its excellence.

For instance, there are the conventional ideas of the
Moors of the Sahara, according to which frequent divorce
is required. It is considered a disgrace to remain long
married to the same person. One who has failed to
divorce his wife after a reasonable time conceals the fact
as the young American in a small town conceals the evidence of an illicit love affair. And again, there is a
famous beauty whose merest flirtation is followed eagerly
by the international press. Every two or three years she
divorces one husband and marries another. It is hardly
credible that this woman's ideals of marriage are such that
she enters upon every one of these marriages with an
identical aspiration toward permanence, and that two or
three years suffice in each case to disillusion her anew.
Much more probably her ideal and purpose is such that
marriage is to her a thing that burns itself out quickly.
In so far as the time factor is concerned, the social convention of the Moors and the personal attitude of the
actress are definitely inferior to conventions and ideals
which seek permanence. This judgment is based upon an
absolute and universal quality of marriage.

The time element, however, is not the only factor in
absolute domestic excellence. There is at least one other
aim which family life should attain. This additional aim
is deduced from the personal character of the family
relationship, just as the permanence aim is deduced from
the temporal quality of marriage. 

\[p.153\] Given the natural family, what is the necessarily characteristic activity or interrelation of parts to which we
can give the name of function, and by which we can
measure success?

Because the family consists of determinate members,
the interrelation of its parts follows the laws of a personal relationship. This would be impossible if the
family membership were substitutive.

Since the characteristic behavior of the family follows
the laws of personal relationship, it is free, that is to say,
it arises within total, unitary personalities and is not
imposed by external circumstances.

Arising within a total personality this behavior is
necessarily motivated, for it is in motivated behavior that
the personality operates as a principal cause.

The quality of the motive in this behavior is also determined by the laws of personal relationship. It necessarily envisages another member of the family as an
end-in-himself, a complete object of value and loyalty.

Thus benevolent activity, arising from a sentiment of
paramount loyalty, is the characteristic activity of the
family members. The success of a family can be judged
by the degree in which it manifests this characteristic
mode of conduct.

These deductions are, of course, implicit in the whole
system of definitions thus far presented and discussed.
The domestic man naturally appears as the ideal of conduct within the family. The success of a family is to be
measured by the degree to which the members approximate in their conduct the behavior of the domestic man.

This is, after all, neither more nor less than that
"affectional" function which, according to Professor Og\[p.154\]burn, is the one service the family continues to perform
for the young people of the Occident. Let us imagine
a family in which no members have the domestic attitude, and each acts solely for himself. If there is any
exchange of services between family members the exchange takes place on a strictly measured basis of barter
and price. No one allows the interests of any other
member to enter into his personal calculations. Judged
by external signs, this family is normal. The neighbors
report no scandal, a biologist observing the family notes
the presence of children to whom, as the sociologist would
testify, the social heritage is being regularly transmitted.
An economist may contribute the information that the
family pays its bills, and a wandering novelist may search
in vain in this home for the sense of tragic unhappiness.
But domestic theory is not satisfied. In the eyes of
domestic theory, this family does not fulfill its functions.
It may suffice as a breeding establishment, a school, or a
hotel, but as a family it leaves the important things
undone.

The normal young men and women of our day think
first of affection when they think of marriage. Children
come later; the economic argument is usually against
marriage rather than in favor of it. Marriages are
launched in affection with the purpose that the affection
shall last. This function (described by lovers in an infinite number of ways) is for us the true function of the
family.

In setting the purpose and estimating the success of a
marriage two principal factors are therefore to be computed. On the one hand the intensity of domestic interaction; on the other hand the duration of the marriage. \[p.155\] These are two independent variables. A marriage might
last long with a minimum of domestic interaction, or it
might be quickly terminated, although it had been during
its brief existence a field for the intensive play of benevolent activity and appreciation. The best marriage is
that which is at once most permanent and most highly
charged with domestic interaction.
